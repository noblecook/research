The reference to such certificate or certification shall be substantially in the following form:\n</P>\n<EXTRACT>\n<P>This product accompanied at the time of the importation by a certificate issued by the\n</P>\n<FP-DASH>\n</FP-DASH>\n<HD3>(Name of government)\n</HD3>\n<P>government indicating that the product is\n</P>\n<FP-DASH>\n</FP-DASH>\n<HD3>(Class and type as stated on the label)\n</HD3>\n<P>and (if label bears a statement of vintage date) that the wine is of the vintage of\n</P>\n<FP-DASH>\n</FP-DASH>\n<HD3>(Year of vintage stated on the label)</HD3></EXTRACT>\n<P>(f) <I>Use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cImporter\xe2\x80\x9d, or similar words.</I> The word <I>Importer,</I> or similar words, shall not be stated on labels on containers of domestic wine except as part of the bona fide name of a permittee for or by whom, or of a retailer for whom, such wine is bottled, packed or distributed: <I>Provided,</I> That in all cases where such words are used as part of such name, there shall be stated on the same label the words \xe2\x80\x9cProduct of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d, or similar words to negative any impression that the product is imported, and such negative statement shall appear in the same size and kind of printing as such name.\n</P>\n<P>(g) <I>Flags, seals, coats of arms, crests, and other insignia.</I> Labels shall not contain, in the brand name or otherwise, any statement, design, device, or pictorial representation which the appropriate TTB officer finds relates to, or is capable of being construed as relating to, the armed forces of the United States, or the American flag, or any emblem, seal, insignia, or decoration associated with such flag or armed forces; nor shall any label contain any statement, design, device, or pictorial representation of or concerning any flag, seal, coat of arms, crest or other insignia, likely to mislead the consumer to believe that the product has been endorsed, made, or used by, or produced for, or under the supervision of, or in accordance with the specifications of the government, organization, family, or individual with whom such flag, seal, coat of arms, crest, or insignia is associated.\n</P>\n<P>(h) <I>Health-related statements</I> - (1) <I>Definitions.</I> When used in this paragraph (h), terms are defined as follows:\n</P>\n<P>(i) <I>Health-related statement</I> means any statement related to health (other than the warning statement required by \xc2\xa7 16.21 of this chapter) and includes statements of a curative or therapeutic nature that, expressly or by implication, suggest a relationship between the consumption of alcohol, wine, or any substance found within the wine, and health benefits or effects on health. The term includes both specific health claims and general references to alleged health benefits or effects on health associated with the consumption of alcohol, wine, or any substance found within the wine, as well as health-related directional statements. The term also includes statements and claims that imply that a physical or psychological sensation results from consuming the wine, as well as statements and claims of nutritional value (e.g., statements of vitamin content). Statements concerning caloric, carbohydrate, protein, and fat content do not constitute nutritional claims about the product.\n</P>\n<P>(ii) <I>Specific health claim</I> is a type of health-related statement that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of the wine, alcohol, or any substance found within the wine, to a disease or health-related condition. Implied specific health claims include statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication that suggest, within the context in which they are presented, that a relationship exists between wine, alcohol, or any substance found within the wine, and a disease or health-related condition.\n</P>\n<P>(iii) <I>Health-related directional statement</I> is a type of health-related statement that directs or refers consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the effects on health of wine or alcohol consumption.\n</P>\n<P>(2) <I>Rules for labeling</I> - (i) <I>Health-related statements.</I> In general, labels may not contain any health-related statement that is untrue in any particular or tends to create a misleading impression as to the effects on health of alcohol consumption. TTB will evaluate such statements on a case-by-case basis and may require as part of the health-related statement a disclaimer or some other qualifying statement to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related statement.\n</P>\n<P>(ii) <I>Specific health claims.</I> (A) TTB will consult with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as needed, on the use of a specific health claim on a wine label. If FDA determines that the use of such a labeling claim is a drug claim that is not in compliance with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, TTB will not approve the use of that specific health claim on a wine label.\n</P>\n<P>(B) TTB will approve the use of a specific health claim on a wine label only if the claim is truthful and adequately substantiated by scientific or medical evidence; sufficiently detailed and qualified with respect to the categories of individuals to whom the claim applies; adequately discloses the health risks associated with both moderate and heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines the categories of individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption may cause health risks. This information must appear as part of the specific health claim.\n</P>\n<P>(iii) <I>Health-related directional statements.</I> A statement that directs consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the effects on health of wine or alcohol consumption is presumed misleading unless it - \n</P>\n<P>(A) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the effects on health of wine or alcohol consumption; and\n</P>\n<P>(B)(<I>1</I>) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement the following disclaimer: \xe2\x80\x9cThis statement should not encourage you to drink or to increase your alcohol consumption for health reasons;\xe2\x80\x9d or\n</P>\n<P>(<I>2</I>) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB officer finds is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related directional statement.\n</P>\n<P>(i) <I>Geographic brand names.</I> (1) Except as provided in subparagraph 2, a brand name of viticultural significance may not be used unless the wine meets the appellation of origin requirements for the geographic area named.\n</P>\n<P>(2) For brand names used in existing certificates of label approval issued prior to July 7, 1986:\n</P>\n<P>(i) The wine shall meet the appellation of origin requirements for the geographic area named; or\n</P>\n<P>(ii) The wine shall be labeled with an appellation of origin in accordance with \xc2\xa7 4.34(b) as to location and size of type of either:\n</P>\n<P>(A) A county or a viticultural area, if the brand name bears the name of a geographic area smaller than a state, or;\n</P>\n<P>(B) A state, county or a viticultural area, if the brand name bears a state name; or\n</P>\n<P>(iii) The wine shall be labeled with some other statement which the appropriate TTB officer finds to be sufficient to dispel the impression that the geographic area suggested by the brand name is indicative of the origin of the wine.\n</P>\n<P>(3) A name has viticultural significance when it is the name of a state or county (or the foreign equivalents), when approved as a viticultural area in part 9 of this chapter, or by a foreign government, or when found to have viticultural significance by the appropriate TTB officer.\n</P>\n<P>(j) <I>Product names of geographical significance (not mandatory before January 1, 1983).</I> The use of product names with specific geographical significance is prohibited unless the appropriate TTB officer finds that because of their long usage, such names are recognized by consumers as fanciful product names and not representations as to origin. In such cases the product names shall be qualified with the word \xe2\x80\x9cbrand\xe2\x80\x9d immediately following the product name, in the same size of type, and as conspicuous as the product name itself. In addition, the label shall bear an appellation of origin under the provisions of \xc2\xa7 4.34(b), and, if required by the appropriate TTB officer, a statement disclaiming the geographical reference as a representation as to the origin of the wine.\n</P>\n<P>(k) <I>Other indications of origin.</I> Other statements, designs, devices or representations which indicate or infer an origin other than the true place of origin of the wine are prohibited.\n</P>\n<P>(l) <I>Foreign terms.</I> Foreign terms which: (1) Describe a particular condition of the grapes at the time of harvest (such as \xe2\x80\x9cAuslese,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cEiswein,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cTrockenbeerenauslese\xe2\x80\x9d); or (2) denote quality under foreign law (such as \xe2\x80\x9cQualitatswein\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cKabinett\xe2\x80\x9d) may not be used on the labels of American wine.\n</P>\n<P>(m) <I>Use of a vineyard, orchard, farm or ranch name.</I> When used in a brand name, a vineyard, orchard, farm or ranch name having geographical or viticultural significance is subject to the requirements of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 4.33(b) and 4.39(i) of this part. Additionally, the name of a vineyard, orchard, farm or ranch shall not be used on a wine label, unless 95 percent of the wine in the container was produced from primary winemaking material grown on the named vineyard, orchard, farm or ranch.\n</P>\n<P>(n) <I>Use of a varietal name, type designation of varietal significance, semi-generic name, or geographic distinctive designation.</I> Labels that contain in the brand name, product name, or distinctive or fanciful name, any varietal (grape type) designation, type designation of varietal significance, semi-generic geographic type designation, or geographic distinctive designation, are misleading unless the wine is made in accordance with the standards prescribed in classes 1, 2, or 3 of \xc2\xa7 4.21. Any other use of such a designation on other than a class 1, 2, or 3 wine is presumed misleading.\n</P>\n<CITA TYPE="N">[T.D. 6521, 25 FR 13841, Dec. 29, 1960]\n</CITA>\n<EDNOTE>\n<HED>Editorial Note:</HED><PSPACE>For <E T="04">Federal Register</E> citations affecting \xc2\xa7 4.39, see the List of CFR Sections Affected, which appears in the Finding Aids section of the printed volume and at <I>www.fdsys.gov.</I></PSPACE></EDNOTE>\n</DIV8>\n\n</DIV6>\n\n\n<DIV6 N="E" NODE="27:1.0.1.1.2.5" TYPE="SUBPART">\n<HEAD>Subpart E - Requirements for Withdrawal of Wine From Customs Custody</HEAD>\n\n\n<DIV8 N="\xc2\xa7 4.40" NODE="27:1.0.1.1.2.5.25.1" TYPE="SECTION">\n<HEAD>\xc2\xa7 4.40   Label approval and release.</HEAD>\n<P>(a) <I>Certificate of label approval.</I> Wine, imported in containers, is not eligible for release from customs custody for consumption, and no person may remove such wine from customs custody for consumption, unless the person removing the wine has obtained and is in possession of a certificate of label approval (COLA) and the containers bear labels identical to the labels appearing on the face of the certificate, or labels with changes authorized by the form. Any person removing wine in containers from customs custody for consumption must first apply for and obtain a COLA covering the wine from the appropriate TTB officer, or obtain authorization to use the COLA from the person to whom the COLA is issued. Products imported under another person\'s COLA are eligible for release only if each bottle or individual container to be imported bears the name (or trade name) and address of the person to whom the COLA was issued by TTB, and only if the importer using the COLA to obtain release of a shipment can substantiate that the person to whom the COLA was issued has authorized its use by the importer.

Such disclaimer or other qualifying statement must appear as prominent as the health-related statement.\n</P>\n<P>(ii) <I>Specific health claims.</I> A specific health claim will not be considered misleading if it is truthful and adequately substantiated by scientific or medical evidence; sufficiently detailed and qualified with respect to the categories of individuals to whom the claim applies; adequately discloses the health risks associated with both moderate and heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines the categories of individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption may cause health risks. This information must appear as part of the specific health claim and in a manner as prominent as the specific health claim.\n</P>\n<P>(iii) <I>Health-related directional statements.</I> A statement that directs consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the effects on health of wine or alcohol consumption is presumed misleading unless it - \n</P>\n<P>(A) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the effects on health of wine or alcohol consumption; and\n</P>\n<P>(B)(<I>1</I>) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement, and in a manner as prominent as the health-related directional statement, the following disclaimer: \xe2\x80\x9cThis statement should not encourage you to drink or increase your alcohol consumption for health reasons;\xe2\x80\x9d or\n</P>\n<P>(<I>2</I>) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement, and in a manner as prominent as the health-related directional statement, some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB officer finds is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related directional statement.\n</P>\n<P>(j) <I>Confusion of brands.</I> Two or more different brands or lots of wine shall not be advertised in one advertisement (or in two or more advertisements in one issue of a periodical or newspaper, or in one piece of other written, printed, or graphic matter) if the advertisement tends to create the impression that representations made as to one brand or lot apply to the other or others, and if as to such latter the representations contravene any provision of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 4.60 through 4.64 or are in any respect untrue.\n</P>\n<P>(k) <I>Deceptive advertising techniques.</I> Subliminal or similar techniques are prohibited. \xe2\x80\x9cSubliminal or similar techniques,\xe2\x80\x9d as used in this part, refers to any device or technique that is used to convey, or attempts to convey, a message to a person by means of images or sounds of a very brief nature that cannot be perceived at a normal level of awareness.\n</P>\n<CITA TYPE="N">[T.D. 6521, 25 FR 13843, Dec. 29, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6976, 33 FR 15025, Oct. 8, 1968; T.D.

The term includes both specific health claims and general references to alleged health benefits or effects on health associated with the consumption of alcohol, distilled spirits, or any substance found within the distilled spirits, as well as health-related directional statements. The term also includes statements and claims that imply that a physical or psychological sensation results from consuming the distilled spirits, as well as statements and claims of nutritional value (e.g., statements of vitamin content). Statements concerning caloric, carbohydrate, protein, and fat content do not constitute nutritional claims about the product.\n</P>\n<P>(B) <I>Specific health claim</I> is a type of health-related statement that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of the distilled spirits, alcohol, or any substance found within the distilled spirits, to a disease or health-related condition.

TTB will evaluate such statements on a case-by-case basis and may require as part of the health-related statement a disclaimer or some other qualifying statement to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related statement.\n</P>\n<P>(B) <I>Specific health claims.</I> (<I>1</I>) TTB will consult with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as needed, on the use of a specific health claim on a distilled spirits label. If FDA determines that the use of such a labeling claim is a drug claim that is not in compliance with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, TTB will not approve the use of that specific health claim on a distilled spirits label.\n</P>\n<P>(<I>2</I>) TTB will approve the use of a specific health claim on a distilled spirits label only if the claim is truthful and adequately substantiated by scientific or medical evidence; sufficiently detailed and qualified with respect to the categories of individuals to whom the claim applies; adequately discloses the health risks associated with both moderate and heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines the categories of individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption may cause health risks. This information must appear as part of the specific health claim.\n</P>\n<P>(C) <I>Health-related directional statements.</I> A statement that directs consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the effects on health of distilled spirits or alcohol consumption is presumed misleading unless it - \n</P>\n<P>(<I>1</I>) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the effects on health of distilled spirits or alcohol consumption; and\n</P>\n<P>(<I>2</I>)(<I>i</I>) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement the following disclaimer: \xe2\x80\x9cThis statement should not encourage you to drink or to increase your alcohol consumption for health reasons;\xe2\x80\x9d or\n</P>\n<P>(<I>ii</I>) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB officer finds is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related directional statement. \n</P>\n<SECAUTH TYPE="N">(26 U.S.C. 7805 (68A Stat. 917, as amended); 27 U.S.C. 205 (49 Stat. 981, as amended))\n</SECAUTH>\n<CITA TYPE="N">[T.D. 7020, 34 FR 20637, Dec. 30, 1969, as amended by T.D.

Such disclaimer or other qualifying statement must appear as prominent as the health-related statement.\n</P>\n<P>(ii) <I>Specific health claims.</I> A specific health claim will not be considered misleading if it is truthful and adequately substantiated by scientific or medical evidence; sufficiently detailed and qualified with respect to the categories of individuals to whom the claim applies; adequately discloses the health risks associated with both moderate and heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines the categories of individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption may cause health risks.

The term includes both specific health claims and general references to alleged health benefits or effects on health associated with the consumption of alcohol, malt beverages, or any substance found within the malt beverage, as well as health-related directional statements. The term also includes statements and claims that imply that a physical or psychological sensation results from consuming the malt beverage, as well as statements and claims of nutritional value (e.g., statements of vitamin content). Statements concerning caloric, carbohydrate, protein, and fat content do not constitute nutritional claims about the product.\n</P>\n<P>(ii) <I>Specific health claim</I> is a type of health-related statement that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of the malt beverage, alcohol, or any substance found within the malt beverage, to a disease or health-related condition.

If FDA determines that the use of such a labeling claim is a drug claim that is not in compliance with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, TTB will not approve the use of that specific health claim on a malt beverage label.\n</P>\n<P>(B) TTB will approve the use of a specific health claim on a malt beverage label only if the claim is truthful and adequately substantiated by scientific or medical evidence; sufficiently detailed and qualified with respect to the categories of individuals to whom the claim applies; adequately discloses the health risks associated with both moderate and heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines the categories of individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption may cause health risks. This information must appear as part of the specific health claim.\n</P>\n<P>(iii) <I>Health-related directional statements.</I> A statement that directs consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the effects on health of malt beverage or alcohol consumption is presumed misleading unless it - \n</P>\n<P>(A) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the effects on health of malt beverage or alcohol consumption; and\n</P>\n<P>(B)(<I>1</I>) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement the following disclaimer: \xe2\x80\x9cThis statement should not encourage you to drink or to increase your alcohol consumption for health reasons;\xe2\x80\x9d or\n</P>\n<P>(<I>2</I>) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB officer finds is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related directional statement. \n</P>\n<P>(f) <I>Use of words \xe2\x80\x9cstrong,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfull strength,\xe2\x80\x9d and similar words.</I> Labels shall not contain the words \xe2\x80\x9cstrong,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfull strength,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cextra strength,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chigh test,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chigh proof,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpre-war strength,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfull oldtime alcoholic strength,\xe2\x80\x9d or similar words or statements, likely to be considered as statements of alcoholic content, unless required by State law.

The petition must contain sufficient information, data, and evidence such that no independent verification or research is required by TTB.\n</P>\n<P>(1) <I>Name evidence.</I> The name identified for the proposed AVA must be currently and directly associated with an area in which viticulture exists. All of the area within the proposed AVA boundary must be nationally or locally known by the name specified in the petition, although the use of that name may extend beyond the proposed AVA boundary. The name evidence must conform to the following rules:\n</P>\n<P>(i) <I>Name usage.</I> The petition must completely explain, in narrative form, the manner in which the name is used for the area covered by the proposed AVA.\n</P>\n<P>(ii) <I>Source of name and name evidence.</I> The name and the evidence in support of it must come from sources independent of the petitioner. Appropriate name evidence sources include, but are not limited to, historical and modern government or commercial maps, books, newspapers, magazines, tourist and other promotional materials, local business or school names, and road names. Whenever practicable, the petitioner must include with the petition copies of the name evidence materials, appropriately cross-referenced in the petition narrative. Although anecdotal information by itself is not sufficient, statements taken from local residents with knowledge of the name and its use may also be included to support other name evidence.\n</P>\n<P>(2) <I>Boundary evidence.</I> The petition must explain in detail the basis for defining the boundary of the proposed AVA as set forth in the petition. This explanation must have reference to the name evidence and other distinguishing features information required under this section. In support of the proposed boundary, the petition must outline the commonalities or similarities within that boundary and must explain with specificity how those elements are different in the adjacent areas outside that boundary.\n</P>\n<P>(3) <I>Distinguishing features.</I> The petition must provide, in narrative form, a description of the common or similar features of the proposed AVA affecting viticulture that make it distinctive. The petition must also explain with specificity in what way these features affect viticulture and how they are distinguished viticulturally from features associated with adjacent areas outside the proposed AVA boundary. For purposes of this section, information relating to distinguishing features affecting viticulture includes the following:\n</P>\n<P>(i) <I>Climate.</I> Temperature, precipitation, wind, fog, solar orientation and radiation, and other climate information;\n</P>\n<P>(ii) <I>Geology.</I> Underlying formations, landforms, and such geophysical events as earthquakes, eruptions, and major floods;\n</P>\n<P>(iii) <I>Soils.</I> Soil series or phases of a soil series, denoting parent material, texture, slope, permeability, soil reaction, drainage, and fertility;\n</P>\n<P>(iv) <I>Physical features.</I> Flat, hilly, or mountainous topography, geographical formations, bodies of water, watersheds, irrigation resources, and other physical features; and\n</P>\n<P>(v) <I>Elevation.</I> Minimum and maximum elevations.\n</P>\n<P>(4) <I>Maps and boundary description.</I>  - (i) <I>Maps.</I> The petitioner must submit with the petition, in an appropriate scale, the U.S.G.S. map(s) showing the location of the proposed AVA. The exact boundary of the AVA must be prominently and clearly drawn on the maps without obscuring the underlying features that define the boundary line. U.S.G.S. maps may be obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey, Branch of Distribution. If the map name is not known, the petitioner may request a map index by State.\n</P>\n<P>(ii) <I>Boundary description.</I> The petition must include a detailed narrative description of the proposed AVA boundary based on U.S.G.S. map markings. This description must have a specific beginning point, must proceed unbroken from that point in a clockwise direction, and must return to that beginning point to complete the boundary description. The boundary description must refer to easily discernable reference points on the U.S.G.S. maps. The proposed AVA boundary description may rely on any of the following map features:\n</P>\n<P>(A) State, county, township, forest, and other political entity lines;\n</P>\n<P>(B) Highways, roads (including unimproved roads), and trails;\n</P>\n<P>(C) Contour or elevation lines;\n</P>\n<P>(D) Natural geographical features, including rivers, streams, creeks, ridges, and marked elevation points (such as summits or benchmarks);\n</P>\n<P>(E) Human-made features (such as bridges, buildings, windmills, or water tanks); and\n</P>\n<P>(F) Straight lines between marked intersections, human-made features, or other map points.\n</P>\n<P>(b) <I>AVAs within AVAs.</I> If the petition proposes the establishment of a new AVA entirely within, or overlapping, an existing AVA, the evidence submitted under paragraph (a) of this section must include information that both identifies the attributes of the proposed AVA that are consistent with the existing AVA and explains how the proposed AVA is sufficiently distinct from the existing AVA and therefore appropriate for separate recognition. If the petition proposes the establishment of a new AVA that is larger than, and encompasses, all of one or more existing AVAs, the evidence submitted under paragraph (a) of this section must include information addressing whether, and to what extent, the attributes of the proposed AVA are consistent with those of the existing AVA(s). In any case in which an AVA would be created entirely within another AVA, whether by the establishment of a new, larger AVA or by the establishment of a new AVA within an existing one, the petition must explain why establishment of the AVA is acceptable. When a smaller AVA has name recognition and features that so clearly distinguish it from a larger AVA that surrounds it, TTB may determine in the course of the rulemaking that it is not part of the larger AVA and that wine produced from grapes grown within the smaller AVA would not be entitled to use the name of the larger AVA as an appellation of origin or in a brand name.\n</P>\n<P>(c) <I>Modification of an existing AVA</I> - (1) <I>Boundary change.</I> If a petition seeks to change the boundary of an existing AVA, the petitioner must include with the petition all relevant evidence and other information specified for a new AVA petition in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. This evidence or information must include, at a minimum, the following:\n</P>\n<P>(i) <I>Name evidence.</I> If the proposed change involves an expansion of the existing boundary, the petition must show how the name of the existing AVA also applies to the expansion area. If the proposed change would result in a decrease in the size of an existing AVA, the petition must explain, if so, the extent to which the AVA name does not apply to the excluded area.\n</P>\n<P>(ii) <I>Distinguishing features.</I> The petition must demonstrate that the area covered by the proposed change has, or does not have, distinguishing features affecting viticulture that are essentially the same as those of the existing AVA. If the proposed change involves an expansion of the existing AVA, the petition must demonstrate that the area covered by the expansion has the same distinguishing features as those of the existing AVA and has different features from those of the area outside the proposed, new boundary. If the proposed change would result in a decrease in the size of an existing AVA, the petition must explain how the distinguishing features of the excluded area are different from those within the boundary of the smaller AVA. In all cases the distinguishing features must affect viticulture.\n</P>\n<P>(iii) <I>Boundary evidence and description.</I> The petition must explain how the boundary of the existing AVA was incorrectly or incompletely defined or is no longer accurate due to new evidence or changed circumstances, with reference to the name evidence and distinguishing features of the existing AVA and of the area affected by the proposed boundary change. The petition must include the appropriate U.S.G.S. maps with the proposed boundary change drawn on them and must provide a detailed narrative description of the changed boundary.\n</P>\n<P>(2) <I>Name change.</I> If a petition seeks to change the name of an existing AVA, the petition must establish the suitability of that name change by providing the name evidence specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.\n\n\n</P>\n</DIV8>\n\n\n<DIV8 N="\xc2\xa7 9.13" NODE="27:1.0.1.1.7.2.41.3" TYPE="SECTION">\n<HEAD>\xc2\xa7 9.13   Initial processing of AVA petitions.</HEAD>\n<P>(a) <I>TTB notification to petitioner of petition receipt.</I> The appropriate TTB officer will acknowledge receipt of a submitted petition.
