# This module declares the following RuleML elements and attributes:
#           * <Equivalent>
#           * <torso>

## an extension point for specializations of the equivalence tag name.  
Equivalent-node.choice |= Equivalent.Node.def

## An equivalence expression, which is "syntactic sugar" for a pair of conjoined converse implication rules (<Implies>). 
## It consists of a pair of (optionally skipped) <torso> roles. 
## For example, "A person owning an object is equivalent to an object belonging to a person":
## See http://deliberation.ruleml.org/1.02/glossary/#gloss-Equivalent 
Equivalent.Node.def =
  
  ## <Equivalent>: Syntactic sugar for two implications. See 
  ## http://deliberation.ruleml.org/1.02/glossary/#gloss-Equivalent 
  element Equivalent { Equivalent.type.def }
Equivalent.type.def =
  (Equivalent-datt.choice & reEquivalent.attlist), Equivalent.header, Equivalent.main

## Equivalences may have an optional closure attribute 
## and will accept a scoped closure attribute at full first-order logic.
reEquivalent.attlist &= closure-att.choice?
reEquivalent.attlist &= mapClosure-att-fo.choice?
# For the declaration of the closure attribute pattern, see the quantification closure module (closure_expansion_module)

## Equivalences accept the header patter common to truth-valued connectives.
Equivalent.header &= TruthValuedConnective.header?
# For the declaration of the TruthValuedConnective header, see the modules ordered_groups_expansion_module and unordered_groups_expansion_module).

## the main content model of equivalances consists of two "torso" formulas
Equivalent.main |= torso-edge.choice, torso-edge.choice

## an extension point for stripe skipping as well as specializations of the torso tag name in equivalences.  
torso-edge.choice |= torso.edge.def

##  A symmetric role used in an equivalence expression (<Equivalent>) combining the asymmetric <then> and <if>.
torso.edge.def =
  
  ## <torso>: contains one formula within an equivalence. See 
  ## http://deliberation.ruleml.org/1.02/glossary/#gloss-torso 
  element torso { torso.type.def }
torso.type.def = torso.attlist? & torso.content
torso.attlist &= commonInit.attlist?

## An equivalance is syntactic sugar for two implications.
## In all RuleML languages, formulas allowed as premises are the same or more general than those allowed as conclusions,
## because this is a requirement for the statement "P implies P" to be syntactically valid whenever P is a valid conclusion.
## Therefore, formulas allowed in equivalences are the same as those allowed in conclusions.
torso.content |= ConclusionFormula.choice
# For the declaration of the conclusion pattern, see the implication module (implication_expansion_module).
reEquivalent.attlist &= commonNode.attlist?
