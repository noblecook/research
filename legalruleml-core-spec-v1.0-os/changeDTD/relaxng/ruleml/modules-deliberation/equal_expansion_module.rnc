# This module declares the following RuleML elements and attributes:

## an extension point for specializations of the equation tag name.  
Equal-node.choice |= Equal.Node.def

## An equational formula consisting of two expressions, each of which contains an argument and may be optionally surrounded 
## by a left (<left>) or a right (<right>) role.

## The children of the equation element are divided into two sections, a header section for modifiers, and a main section for the formulas on either side of the equation. 
Equal.Node.def =
  
  ## <Equal>: an equation between two terms. See

## Equations accept the header of truth-valued connectives
Equal.header &= TruthValuedConnective.header?
# For the declaration of the TruthValuedConnective header, see the modules ordered_groups_expansion_module and unordered_groups_expansion_module).

## Equations contain a pair of terms, a left-hand side and a right-hand side.
