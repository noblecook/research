      <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods for verifiable parental consent.</E> (1) An operator must make reasonable efforts to obtain verifiable parental consent, taking into consideration available technology. Any method to obtain verifiable parental consent must be reasonably calculated, in light of available technology, to ensure that the person providing consent is the child's parent. (2) Existing methods to obtain verifiable parental consent that satisfy the requirements of this paragraph include:</P>
      <P>(i) Providing a consent form to be signed by the parent and returned to the operator by postal mail, facsimile, or electronic scan;</P>
      <P>(ii) Requiring a parent, in connection with a monetary transaction, to use a credit card, debit card, or other online payment system that provides notification of each discrete transaction to the primary account holder;</P>

Such additional steps include: Sending a confirmatory email to the parent following receipt of consent, or obtaining a postal address or telephone number from the parent and confirming the parent's consent by letter or telephone call. An operator that uses this method must provide notice that the parent can revoke any consent given in response to the earlier email.</P>
      <P>(3) <E T="03">Safe harbor approval of parental consent methods.</E> A safe harbor program approved by the Commission under § 312.11 may approve its member operators' use of a parental consent method not currently enumerated in paragraph (b)(2) of this section where the safe harbor program determines that such parental consent method meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
      <P>(c) <E T="03">Exceptions to prior parental consent.</E> Verifiable parental consent is required prior to any collection, use, or disclosure of personal information from a child <E T="03">except</E> as set forth in this paragraph:</P>

      <P>(4) Where the purpose of collecting a child's and a parent's online contact information is to respond directly more than once to the child's specific request, and where such information is not used for any other purpose, disclosed, or combined with any other information collected from the child. In such cases, the operator must make reasonable efforts, taking into consideration available technology, to ensure that the parent receives notice as described in § 312.4(c)(3). An operator will not be deemed to have made reasonable efforts to ensure that a parent receives notice where the notice to the parent was unable to be delivered;</P>
      <P>(5) Where the purpose of collecting a child's and a parent's name and online contact information, is to protect the safety of a child, and where such information is not used or disclosed for any purpose unrelated to the child's safety.

At a minimum, this mechanism must include a comprehensive review by the safe harbor program, to be conducted not less than annually, of each subject operator's information policies, practices, and representations. The assessment mechanism required under this paragraph can be provided by an independent enforcement program, such as a seal program.<PRTPAGE P="408"/>
      </P>
      <P>(3) Disciplinary actions for subject operators' non-compliance with self-regulatory program guidelines. This performance standard may be satisfied by:</P>
      <P>(i) Mandatory, public reporting of any action taken against subject operators by the industry group issuing the self-regulatory guidelines;</P>
      <P>(ii) Consumer redress;</P>
      <P>(iii) Voluntary payments to the United States Treasury in connection with an industry-directed program for violators of the self-regulatory guidelines;</P>
      <P>(iv) Referral to the Commission of operators who engage in a pattern or practice of violating the self-regulatory guidelines; or</P>
      <P>(v) Any other equally effective action.</P>
      <P>(c) <E T="03">Request for Commission approval of self-regulatory program guidelines.</E> A proposed safe harbor program's request for approval shall be accompanied by the following:</P>
      <P>(1) A detailed explanation of the applicant's business model, and the technological capabilities and mechanisms that will be used for initial and continuing assessment of subject operators' fitness for membership in the safe harbor program;</P>
      <P>(2) A copy of the full text of the guidelines for which approval is sought and any accompanying commentary;</P>
      <P>(3) A comparison of each provision of §§ 312.2 through 312.8, and 312.10 with the corresponding provisions of the guidelines; and</P>
      <P>(4) A statement explaining:</P>
      <P>(i) How the self-regulatory program guidelines, including the applicable assessment mechanisms, meet the requirements of this part; and</P>
      <P>(ii) How the assessment mechanisms and compliance consequences required under paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) provide effective enforcement of the requirements of this part.</P>
      <P>(d) <E T="03">Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.</E> Approved safe harbor programs shall:</P>
      <P>(1) By July 1, 2014, and annually thereafter, submit a report to the Commission containing, at a minimum, an aggregated summary of the results of the independent assessments conducted under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a description of any disciplinary action taken against any subject operator under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and a description of any approvals of member operators' use of a parental consent mechanism, pursuant to § 312.5(b)(3);</P>
      <P>(2) Promptly respond to Commission requests for additional information; and</P>
      <P>(3) Maintain for a period not less than three years, and upon request make available to the Commission for inspection and copying:</P>
      <P>(i) Consumer complaints alleging violations of the guidelines by subject operators;</P>
      <P>(ii) Records of disciplinary actions taken against subject operators; and</P>
      <P>(iii) Results of the independent assessments of subject operators' compliance required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
      <P>(e) <E T="03">Post-approval modifications to self-regulatory program guidelines.</E> Approved safe harbor programs must submit proposed changes to their guidelines for review and approval by the Commission in the manner required for initial approval of guidelines under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The statement required under paragraph (c)(4) of this section must describe how the proposed changes affect existing provisions of the guidelines.</P>
      <P>(f) <E T="03">Revocation of approval of self-regulatory program guidelines.</E> The Commission reserves the right to revoke any approval granted under this section if at any time it determines that the approved self-regulatory program guidelines or their implementation do not meet the requirements of this part. Safe harbor programs that were approved prior to the publication of the Final Rule amendments must, by March 1, 2013, submit proposed modifications to their guidelines that would bring them into compliance with such amendments, or their approval shall be revoked.</P>
      <P>(g) <E T="03">Operators' participation in a safe harbor program.</E> An operator will be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of §§ 312.2 through 312.8, and 312.10 if that operator complies with Commission-approved safe harbor program guidelines. In considering whether to initiate an investigation or <PRTPAGE P="409"/>bring an enforcement action against a subject operator for violations of this part, the Commission will take into account the history of the subject operator's participation in the safe harbor program, whether the subject operator has taken action to remedy such non-compliance, and whether the operator's non-compliance resulted in any one of the disciplinary actions set forth in paragraph (b)(3).</P>
