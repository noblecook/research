    <SUBJECT>Parental consent.</SUBJECT>
    <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> (1) An operator must obtain verifiable parental consent before any collection, use, or disclosure of personal information from children, including consent to any material change in the collection, use, or disclosure practices to which the parent has previously consented.</P>
    <P>(2) An operator must give the parent the option to consent to the collection and use of the child's personal information without consenting to disclosure of his or her personal information to third parties.</P>
    <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods for verifiable parental consent.</E> (1) An operator must make reasonable efforts to obtain verifiable parental consent, taking into consideration available technology. Any method to obtain verifiable parental consent must be reasonably calculated, in light of available technology, to ensure that the person providing consent is the child's parent. (2) Existing methods to obtain verifiable parental consent that satisfy the requirements of this paragraph include:</P>
    <P>(i) Providing a consent form to be signed by the parent and returned to the operator by postal mail, facsimile, or electronic scan;</P>
    <P>(ii) Requiring a parent, in connection with a monetary transaction, to use a credit card, debit card, or other online payment system that provides notification of each discrete transaction to the primary account holder;</P>
    <P>(iii) Having a parent call a toll-free telephone number staffed by trained personnel;</P>
    <P>(iv) Having a parent connect to trained personnel via video-conference;</P>
    <P>(v) Verifying a parent's identity by checking a form of government-issued identification against databases of such information, where the parent's identification is deleted by the operator from its records promptly after such verification is complete; or</P>
    <P>(vi) <E T="03">Provided that,</E> an operator that does not “disclose” (as defined by § 312.2) children's personal information, may use an email coupled with additional steps to provide assurances that the person providing the consent is the parent. Such additional steps include: Sending a confirmatory email to the parent following receipt of consent, or obtaining a postal address or telephone number from the parent and confirming the parent's consent by letter or telephone call. An operator that uses this method must provide notice that the parent can revoke any consent given in response to the earlier email.</P>
    <P>(3) <E T="03">Safe harbor approval of parental consent methods.</E> A safe harbor program approved by the Commission under § 312.11 may approve its member operators' use of a parental consent method not currently enumerated in paragraph (b)(2) of this section where the safe harbor program determines that such parental consent method meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
    <P>(c) <E T="03">Exceptions to prior parental consent.</E> Verifiable parental consent is required prior to any collection, use, or disclosure of personal information from a child <E T="03">except</E> as set forth in this paragraph:</P>

    <P>(1) Where the sole purpose of collecting the name or online contact information of the parent or child is to provide notice and obtain parental consent under § 312.4(c)(1). If the operator has not obtained parental consent after <PRTPAGE P="406"/>a reasonable time from the date of the information collection, the operator must delete such information from its records;</P>
    <P>(2) Where the purpose of collecting a parent's online contact information is to provide voluntary notice to, and subsequently update the parent about, the child's participation in a Web site or online service that does not otherwise collect, use, or disclose children's personal information. In such cases, the parent's online contact information may not be used or disclosed for any other purpose. In such cases, the operator must make reasonable efforts, taking into consideration available technology, to ensure that the parent receives notice as described in § 312.4(c)(2);</P>
    <P>(3) Where the sole purpose of collecting online contact information from a child is to respond directly on a one-time basis to a specific request from the child, and where such information is not used to re-contact the child or for any other purpose, is not disclosed, and is deleted by the operator from its records promptly after responding to the child's request;</P>
    <P>(4) Where the purpose of collecting a child's and a parent's online contact information is to respond directly more than once to the child's specific request, and where such information is not used for any other purpose, disclosed, or combined with any other information collected from the child. In such cases, the operator must make reasonable efforts, taking into consideration available technology, to ensure that the parent receives notice as described in § 312.4(c)(3). An operator will not be deemed to have made reasonable efforts to ensure that a parent receives notice where the notice to the parent was unable to be delivered;</P>
    <P>(5) Where the purpose of collecting a child's and a parent's name and online contact information, is to protect the safety of a child, and where such information is not used or disclosed for any purpose unrelated to the child's safety. In such cases, the operator must make reasonable efforts, taking into consideration available technology, to provide a parent with notice as described in § 312.4(c)(4);</P>
    <P>(6) Where the purpose of collecting a child's name and online contact information is to:</P>
    <P>(i) Protect the security or integrity of its Web site or online service;</P>
    <P>(ii) Take precautions against liability;</P>
    <P>(iii) Respond to judicial process; or</P>
    <P>(iv) To the extent permitted under other provisions of law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies or for an investigation on a matter related to public safety; and where such information is not be used for any other purpose;</P>
    <P>(7) Where an operator collects a persistent identifier and no other personal information and such identifier is used for the sole purpose of providing support for the internal operations of the Web site or online service. In such case, there also shall be no obligation to provide notice under § 312.4; or</P>

    <P>(8) Where an operator covered under paragraph (2) of the definition of <E T="03">Web site or online service directed to children</E> in § 312.2 collects a persistent identifier and no other personal information from a user who affirmatively interacts with the operator and whose previous registration with that operator indicates that such user is not a child. In such case, there also shall be no obligation to provide notice under § 312.4.</P>
