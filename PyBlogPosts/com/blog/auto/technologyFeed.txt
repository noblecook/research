Maybe "put off" is too strong a term for you. Perhaps you\'re, say, perplexed by them? Yes, perplexed -- how\'s that? And, frankly, who wouldn\'t be perplexed? Gangs of overweight bull dykes cruising along on their blustering hogs? Rail-thin twinks dithering about, wearing nothing but glitter and body paint? Big, muscly dudes grinding each other to the drilling beat of unhappy-sounding techno music? And drag queens?! Drag queens galore! Ten-foot drag queens. 300-pound drag queens. Drag queens in leather, pleather, feathers, sequins, furs, nylons, raw meat, you name it. It\'s all so weird. Freakish even. And that\'s the point. Sort of.<br />\n<br />\nMy reaction to my first gay pride parade was probably not too dissimilar to those of many people\'s. Who are these freakshows, and why are they behaving so unseemly, so trashy? And just when I thought I had seen the <em>worst</em> of it, a whole new level of inappropriateness revealed itself before me in the flesh -- and, my, was there lots of it [details redacted for your safety]. Needless to say the whole thing made me feel uncomfortable, confused, dirty. But, above all, it made me feel afraid.<br />\n<br />\nLooking back, the fear was innocent enough, some would even say na\xc3\xafve. I was coming to terms with my own sexuality then (still am), and witnessing those extreme representations of sexual expression only complicated the whole process. You see, like many others, I could only handle a little bit at a time in what I presumed to be the very linear process of coming out as not heterosexual. The reality, of course, is that nothing meaningful in life is truly linear, especially human sexuality. But linearity is, seemingly at least, safe and somewhat controllable. <br />\n<br />\nEven the notion of a \'process\' can feel very comforting. This comfort, however, comes at a price -- a price most LGBT people recognize early on, not only because of but also in spite of the torment, discrimination, and hatefulness many of them have endured. It\'s not unlike enlightenment attained through suffering. And therein lies the paradox, or dichotomy, if you will, of gay pride parades.<br />\n<br />\nLike any other procession (derived from the words, \'process\' or \'proceed\'), there\'s a natural beginning, a middle, and an end to a gay pride parade in terms of both time and sequence. But that\'s pretty much only where the linearity applies. For the parade itself is meant to celebrate the OPPOSITE of linearity. What\'s the opposite of linearity? Well, it can be anything you want it to be: revolution (derived from the words, \'revolt\' or \'revolve\'), centrality, randomness, chaos, nothingness, otherworldliness, what have you.<br />\n<br />\nYou see, those "freakshows" -- with their props and their dancing and their nakedness -- are merely acting as embodiments of the idea that nothing worthwhile in life is so straightforward, or predictable, or right. Additionally, and equally importantly, instead of fearing complexity, randomness, and unknowingness, those so-called freakshows are in fact humbly, if not joyfully, embracing these frightening concepts. In other words, they\'re celebrating their perplexity. (Often quite creatively.)<br />\n<br />\nWhen I write that I\'m still coming to terms with my sexuality, I really mean it. I believe that, as humans, we are fated, or wired, to undertake the complexities of our sexuality no more or less so than any other core aspect of our being. Our essence, after all, isn\'t something we are granted with full consciousness but, rather, something we continuously strive to understand and embrace -- openly, respectfully, and non-linearly.<br />\n<br />\nSo the next time you come across a gay pride parade, whether on the streets or on TV, instead of gawking or judging, take a look at your own openness and humbleness, and be also proud -- proud of your own perplexity (and complexity). It\'s what links you to everybody else, including those freakshows, who maybe won\'t seem so freakish anymore. <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\'http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n      <enclosure url="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1464944/images/s-US_UK_CA-mini.jpg" type="image/jpeg" length="0"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-marsh/jeffrey-marsh-being-gende_b_7244942.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[Jeffrey Marsh: Being Gender Different AND Popular On Social Media]]></title>\n      <author>Jeffrey Marsh</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-marsh/jeffrey-marsh-being-gende_b_7244942.html</link>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2015 16:17:01 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-08-1431117736-4761772-IMG_0184b.jpg"><img alt="2015-05-08-1431117736-4761772-IMG_0184b.jpg" src="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-08-1431117736-4761772-IMG_0184b-thumb.jpg" width="570" height="570" /></a><br />\n<br />\nIt\'s weird that I\'m famous. Actually, a heck of a lot of people <em>haven\'t</em> heard of me, but a heck of a lot have. And they like my posts. And they share my posts. <br />\n<br />\nStill, to this day I experience the shock of being popular. Or perhaps I should say I experience being so different, so non-main-stream, so (let\'s face it) queer, and also being popular. It makes no sense to me. I know I have talent. I know I have a message people want to hear, but success on social media is something I never expected. <br />\n<br />\n<iframe src="https://vine.co/v/eZ9xgLzdlLr/embed/postcard" width="300" height="300" frameborder="0"></iframe><script src="https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js"></script><br />\n<br />\nThere may be a pink glass ceiling on Vine. I haven\'t hit it yet. I\'m liked and I\'m popular and (how shall I put this?) my personal style is far away from most other Viners\' personal style. No other top Viner is playing with identity the way I do, no one is playing with gender. And yes, I get hate. Yes, it\'s more hate than a cute young straight white male gets. Someone who has the gall to be a woman, or gay, AND be popular on social media has got a lot of hate coming. It\'s sad whenever hate happens, but to me being on Vine and getting hate is also totally worth it. I don\'t know if those straight white males who \'get less hate\' or whatever are happy with their lives. I know I\'m happy with mine, for 2 reasons:<br />\n<br />\n1. Time and time again followers comment on how the haters have helped them. They say something like "I\'ve seen you take so much hate and rise above it, so can I". That\'s a miracle! I know hate is useless and groundless and all I have to do is keep going to prove that to anyone who\'s paying attention. It\'s very fulfilling. <br />\n<br />\n2. I\'ve connected with like-minded people -- hundreds of thousands of them actually. <br />\n<br />\nMost folks with large social media followings work with brands that take advantage of their large audiences. There are many brands who haven\'t worked with me yet because of my gender expression. Most folks with large social media followings collaborate with other popular people on their platform, and there are Viners who won\'t work with me because they fear they\'ll lose followers (news flash, they may be right!). <br />\n<br />\nBut none of that matters. Being this popular has plugged me into a community, and has helped me to unearth the people who say yes without hesitation -- who feel the way I do. These are the people who, for whatever reason, are outsiders like me.  Connecting with them is priceless. <br />\n<br />\n<em>Find Jeffrey on</em> <a href="http://vine.co/jeffreymarsh" target="_hplink">Vine</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/jeffreymarshnow" target="_hplink">Twitter</a>. <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\'http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n      <enclosure url="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1464944/images/s-US_UK_CA-mini.jpg" type="image/jpeg" length="0"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nikki-araguz/the-privilege-of-being-pr_b_7232966.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[The Privilege of Being Pretty -- #PassingCanMean #PrettyPower -- The Transgender Struggle]]></title>\n      <author>Nikki Araguz Loyd</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nikki-araguz/the-privilege-of-being-pr_b_7232966.html</link>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2015 16:15:23 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[The way I have been treated in my life has generally been really well. I have never been homeless, jobless or hungry. In fact, when my husband died in 2010 and I became the only and most widely reported story about a Trans* person in America, many people were nice to me. I gained the support of five law firms and 18 lawyers while every news station wanted an interview with me, because I was pretty. <br />\n<br />\nYou see I am 5\'3" and usually weigh around 125lbs. I am small and most people say I am pretty. I don\'t appear to be what many deem as a "stereotypical Trans*" woman, and I am convinced that stroke of luck has provided me a privilege of being pretty.<br />\n<br />\n<center><a href="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-07-1431011081-3774255-_facebook_1202291458.jpg"><img alt="2015-05-07-1431011081-3774255-_facebook_1202291458.jpg" src="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-07-1431011081-3774255-_facebook_1202291458-thumb.jpg" width="300" height="400" /></a></center><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nI have never been harassed going into a women\'s restroom because of my appearance. One of my community\'s biggest attacks and concerns in using public accommodations is being targeted based on their perceived appearance. Being "pretty" whether you are a trans woman or not allows in life better access, safety, and financial opportunity. Now let me be clear, pretty people have problems too, just not the same kind of problems as our less attractive counterparts.<br />\n<br />\nI bring this up because in the discussion of equality for my Trans* identifying brothers and sisters this is a real life obstacle. You see the privilege of "passing" as the gender you identify with can truly be a life or death issue. Passing can mean the difference between walking into a restroom without awkward stares and verbal harassment. Passing can mean getting a job so that you can pay your bills and feed yourself. Passing can mean that someone will rent to you so that you aren\'t homeless. Passing can mean that your friends and family will accept you. <br />\n<br />\nThe reality is that 20% of transgender people are homeless, 38% reported verbal abuse because of their gender identity or gender presentation, 37% reported physical abuse, 46% reported employment discrimination, and 37% reported housing discrimination. These numbers are terrifying for people in my community and the majority of this is because by stereotypical societal standards my people are not pretty or "normal", and I call bullshit. Enough is enough. I am urging every one of my sisters and brothers to be the best they can be, but most importantly to recognize the divine pretty power within each of us. <br />\n<br />\nToday I encourage you to look in the mirror and tell yourself "I am pretty, I am worthy, and I love Me!" and then go tell someone else, and even more I ask that the next time you encounter a transgender individual offer them a kind word about their appearance. Please share with me your #PassingCanMean and #PrettyPower stories on social media. <br />\n<br />\n<a href="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-07-1431011194-8498956-BADBITCHES.jpg"><img alt="2015-05-07-1431011194-8498956-BADBITCHES.jpg" src="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-07-1431011194-8498956-BADBITCHES-thumb.jpg" width="570" height="377" /></a> <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\'http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n      <enclosure url="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1464944/images/s-US_UK_CA-mini.jpg" type="image/jpeg" length="0"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/meredith-hale/i-was-terrified-i-wouldnt_b_7268530.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[I Was Terrified I Wouldn\'t Fall in Love With my Baby. And Then I Did.]]></title>\n      <author>Meredith Hale</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/meredith-hale/i-was-terrified-i-wouldnt_b_7268530.html</link>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2015 16:14:40 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[I didn\'t tell my husband I was pregnant. <br />\n<br />\nI had taken the test on a whim, thinking it was impossible that month -- that our timing had been off. When the test came back positive, I froze. Although we had been trying for a second child for nine months, I wasn\'t ready for the news. I walked around in a daze for over 24 hours, talking to my husband about trivialities: what to buy at the store, who would pick up our daughter from preschool, whether to have chicken or pasta for dinner.  I didn\'t say what was really on my mind. I was pregnant, and I was terrified. <br />\n<br />\nWhen I finally shared the news, he was overjoyed. Having had some time to process things, I was happy too, although a sense of panic overshadowed my joy for our growing family. I wondered how we\'d fit a new person into our already crowded apartment, which felt smaller each passing day. I was nervous about putting my career on pause once again, and attempting to squeeze caring for a newborn into a life that barely accommodated a toddler and two self-owned businesses (not to mention the occasional moment alone together). I remembered the sleepless nights, the fatigue, the constant demands of nursing. I couldn\'t imagine fitting it all in. <br />\n<br />\nBut if I was being honest, work and space had little to do with my fears. I had always been ambivalent about having another baby. I was an only child. Growing up, my parents and I had been the Three Musketeers. Our bond was fierce, whether I was reading and crafting with my mom, or accompanying my dad on field trips with the classes he taught. We spent weeks at a time on the road, exploring the majesty of the Grand Tetons, the exploding geysers of Yellowstone, the barbecue and bluegrass of Dollywood. Through all our ups and downs, I always knew I came first in their hearts. <br />\n<br />\nWhen I gave birth to my daughter, she filled my heart the same way. I strove to give her all the love and attention I had received, to conquer the world together as my parents and I had done years ago. I loved her intensely, completely. And so the thought of another child was terrifying. How could I ever love another child the way I loved my daughter? Was it really possible to fall in that kind of all-consuming love twice? And what if this new baby took my attention from my daughter? What if I was a terrible mother who resented her own baby? The thought left me feeling shaken and alone. <br />\n<br />\nMy delivery was a planned C-section, and as the day approached, I tried to mask my doubts. When we arrived at the hospital, I was distracted by the many details of preparing for surgery. I\'m ashamed to admit it, but up until the moment my son was born, I was still afraid of how I\'d react when I met him. As I lay on that table, I was confused. I was numb. Of course I loved my baby. But I was scared I wouldn\'t fall in love the way a new mother should. <br />\n<br />\nAnd then I did.<br />\n<br />\nThe moment my husband showed me my infant son, cradled in his arms, wrapped in a newborn diaper and tiny hospital-standard shirt and hat, all I could think was: "God, he\'s beautiful." And he was. Breathtakingly, melt-your-heart beautiful. <br />\n<br />\nWhen people ask my husband and I how we met, we describe seeing each other across a crowded room, feeling an instant connection. In reality, we fell in love over time. With my daughter, I had to recover from 36 hours of labor and an emergency C-section before I was aware enough to bond with her. The moment I saw my son, I experienced something I\'d never felt in my life: love at first sight. <br />\n<br />\nIn an instant, I fell hopelessly, utterly in love with my newborn child. It was a new love, separate from my love for my daughter, which somehow remained as unchanged and consuming as ever. Somehow, in a single moment, I transformed from my daughter\'s mother to my children\'s mother. And the world didn\'t screech to a halt. <br />\n<br />\nJust as there was suddenly ample room in my heart, there was room in my life as well. We made space in our apartment; I found a way to balance work and motherhood yet again. I can\'t say none of my fears materialized. There are days I can barely carry on a conversation with my daughter because I\'m trying to prevent my son from running into traffic. But there\'s one fear that, thankfully, was never realized . My heart didn\'t close when my son was born. I fell in love, and every day I fall more deeply under his spell. <br />\n<br />\nAs it turns out, mothers do fall in love more than once. We fall in love every day, for the rest of our lives.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<em>This blog post is part of a series for HuffPost Love Matters, entitled \'Moment I Fell in Love With My Baby.\' To see all the other posts in the series, click <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/baby-love-moments">here.</a> To contribute, submit your 500 - 800 word blogpost to <a href="mailto:lovematters@huffingtonpost.com" target="_top" >lovematters@huffingtonpost.com</a>.</em> <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\'http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n      <enclosure url="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2942902/images/s-BABY-HOSPITAL-mini.jpg" type="image/jpeg" length="0"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/boria-sax-/coming-to-terms-with-the-_2_b_7248042.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[Coming to Terms With the Past, as a Citizen, a Writer and a Human Being]]></title>\n      <author>Boria Sax</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/boria-sax-/coming-to-terms-with-the-_2_b_7248042.html</link>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2015 16:13:41 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA["<em>Vergangenheitsbew\xe1\xbc\x84ltigung</em>" is a coinage in German that is used to mean something like "coming to terms with the past." That is the major theme of post-World War II German literature, but, considering the effort that was expended, leading literary figures have done a remarkably poor job of it. It was an obsession of Christa Wolf, an author in former East Germany who critics long considered a major candidate for the Nobel Prize, as well as of the late G\xe1\xbd\x92nter Grass, who won the Nobel Prize in 1999. <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/112462/city-angels-christa-wolf-reviewed-todd-gitlin" target="_hplink">Wolf managed to block</a> from her mind the fact that she had worked as an informant for the Stasi, the East German secret police, until that was revealed by archives in 1993. For most of his career, Grass hid the fact that he had been a member of the notorious Waffen SS, before finally revealing it in his 2007 memoir <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jun/24/biography.guntergrass" target="_hplink"><em>Peeling the Onion</em></a>.<br />\n<br />\nOne explanation of these failures is offered by their fellow German W. G. Sebald, a major candidate for the Nobel Prize before his premature death in 2001, in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/feb/22/highereducation.history" target="_hplink"><em>On the Natural History of Destruction</em></a> (1999). Even as they acknowledged the Nazi crimes, these German authors had repressed awareness of the suffering that they had witnessed among their own people, when cities were bombed to rubble, people starved, and, at the end of the war, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rm-douglas/expulsion-germans-forced-migration_b_1625437.html" target="_hplink">an additional 2.1 million</a> were killed as the governments of Poland and Czechoslovakia forcibly evicted ethnic Germans from their ancestral homes. Sebald writes, "The almost entire absence of profound disturbance to the inner life of the nation suggests that the new Federal German society relegated the experiences of its own prehistory to the back of its mind and developed an almost perfectly functioning mechanism of repression..."  This does not imply that there was an equivalence between the crimes by and those against the Germans.  The obligation of a writer, however, is to confront his own experience, and the Germans could not do justice to that while hiding so much trauma from themselves.<br />\n<br />\nEvery country, ethnicity, or major subculture has matters that it does not care to acknowledge. The Japanese do not always admit to the sexual abuse of the Korean "comfort women" during World War II, and the Turks regularly deny the genocide of Armenians at the start of World War I.  In the United States we have, of course, the genocide of Native Americans and the enslavement of Blacks, in addition to many other crimes against humanity that only appear "minor" by comparison. <br />\n<br />\nI remain a fairly unregenerate man of the left. In the United States and throughout the world, the left has lost a lot of credibility by its past support of figures such as Stalin, Mao, and Kim Il Sung. As at least a charter member of that community, I feel a special obligation to help redress that failing. In many cases at least, I believe the offense was usually due less to malice than to very human errors of judgement, but that is no excuse for ignoring or trivializing it now. We need to ask why so many of us allowed themselves to be hypnotized by an ideology, to the extent that they failed to perceive some of the most egregious human rights violations ever.<br />\n<br />\nBut, assuming Sebald is correct, there are things about this German pattern of psychological repression that seem paradoxical.  Other countries such as Russia, Ireland, Serbia, and Israel are perpetually commemorating their own suffering yet have trouble acknowledging guilt, the reverse of what Sebald finds in Germany. For Germans, furthermore, <em>Vergangenheitsbew\xe1\xbc\x84ltigung</em> is a matter of values and philosophy, but for Americans it is mostly one of business and politics. In contrast to the Germans, we have engaged in little soul-searching or philosophizing about national crimes. Traditions going back to the first European settlement made America, the "New Eden," the place where humanity might cast off its past, so full of wars and intrigues, and make a fresh start. On some level, we still believe in a primal innocence that might relatively easily be recaptured through a change of heart, if we could only find the right policy. <br />\n<br />\nEvery country, and probably every culture, has its own way of selectively remembering, and forgetting, the past, and perhaps that contributes as much to its identity as the past itself. That is why the national state emerged as a major ideal in the latter nineteenth century, at about the same time as history became a distinct academic discipline. This national style involves selecting a few themes and previous events, which may underscore victory, defeat, empire-building, victimization, triumph, guilt, prosperity, hardship or many other things. These are then taken at least partly out of context and romanticized, often in intellectually highly sophisticated ways. <br />\n<br />\nThat is a sort of mythologizing that generally has remarkably little difficulty accommodating internal contradictions. In the United States, we honor the heroism of both the South, fighting for autonomy, and the North, fighting to end slavery, in the Civil War. In some states such as Arkansas and Mississippi, Martin Luther King Jr., the crusader for Black rights, shares a holiday with Robert E. Lee, commander of the rebellion that opposed Black rights. In a similar way, Russians now often honor adversaries Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Joseph Stalin, and President Vladimir Putin may see himself as the successor to both. The <em>Arc de Triomphe</em> was originally conceived by Napoleon to memorialize his victory in Egypt, which quickly turned into the first in a series of catastrophic defeats. The arch was completed by subsequent regimes, making it simultaneously a celebration of Napoleon, of the French Revolution that he ended, and of the Bourbon Kings who replaced him, along with King Louis-Phillippe who replaced the Bourbons.  Elaborate rationalizations are always essential to national or ethnic identity.<br />\n<br />\nBut the incoherence of virtually all national mythologies begins to become apparent when they are juxtaposed in ways that force their inherent contradictions to the surface. We see this is<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2015/04/28/world/asia/28reuters-ww2-anniversary-russia.html?_r=0" target="_hplink"> the decision</a> of Western leaders to boycott the military parade in Moscow on May 9, 2015, to mark the end of World War II. Their absence reflects a displeasure over Russian support for the rebels in Ukraine, but that, in turn, is intimately tied to differing perspectives on events of World War II, as well as on many that led up to and followed the war. Britain held out against the Nazis almost alone for over a year, and the Americans commanded the Allied forces at D-Day, but it was the Russians who did most of the fighting, <a href="http://www.nationalww2museum.org/learn/education/for-students/ww2-history/ww2-by-the-numbers/world-wide-deaths.html" target="_hplink">losing 20 to 30 million people</a>. Ukrainians remember<a href="http://www.nationalww2museum.org/learn/education/for-students/ww2-history/ww2-by-the-numbers/world-wide-deaths.html" target="_hplink"> the <em>Holodomor</em></a>, the 1922 famine in Ukraine, caused or at least actively encouraged by Stalin, which killed, by some estimates, up to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor" target="_hplink">seven million people or more</a>. The Russians remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_collaborationism_with_the_Axis_powers" target="_hplink">the widespread support for the Nazis in Ukraine</a>, where many people initially greeted them as liberators.  As is so often the case, it is just about impossible to untangle the mix of history, mythology, and politics, among all the countries involved. <br />\n<br />\n"<em>Vergangenheitsbew\xe1\xbc\x84ltigung</em>" literally means "overpowering the past," and that is a thing that we can never do. Why even bother to come to terms with it? Why not simply forget the past, as, indeed, many people today appear to have done? Our link with the past is, in any case, tenuous as best. Edward Gibbon, in <em>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</em>, called history "little more than the register of the crimes, follies, and misfortunes of mankind." Nevertheless, Gibbon devoted his life to recording it. We are easily overwhelmed by the vastness, the brutality, and complexity of the historical record. History contains no clear lessons, and no promise of redemption. I love it anyhow. History, for better or worse, is "us" on a grand scale \xe2\x94\x80 full of secrets, beauty, fear, longing, and stifled love. Without history, our lives would not be complete, and we could not be, in the best sense, fully "human." <br />\n<br />\n<center><a href="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-09-1431183795-1373318-France_Weathervane_1815004.jpg"><img alt="2015-05-09-1431183795-1373318-France_Weathervane_1815004.jpg" src="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-09-1431183795-1373318-France_Weathervane_1815004-thumb.jpg" width="379" height="570" /></a></center><br />\n<em><center>French Cartoon, 1815.

Seated in an alley outside the Varol \xc3\x87ay Ocagi, a tea kitchen, I talked with Sefa Ulusan, one of the men who serve \xc3\xa7ay to the merchants and their customers on the north end of the maze of shops. Snowflakes fell on my face and shoulders as we spoke. What surprised me most about Istanbul in January was that despite the bitter cold and sleet, all the restaurants and shops that I was accustomed to seeing with their street-facing walls opened wide in spring, summer and fall, never shut their doors. Instead, waiters and store clerks as well as the diners simply added layers of clothing. Perhaps they did this out of necessity (lack of space inside) and because of their socially convivial nature.<br />\n<br />\nI traveled to Istanbul to resume work on a book Street Wise Istanbul, essays based on conversations with vendors, artisans and others who make their living on the street. I found their commitment to a work ethic, to the sustainability of the planet and equal rights for all, were much like the concerns and wishes of people everywhere. Similarly, so were their grievances over the ensuing tragedies that week, in their own country and abroad. <br />\n<br />\nVarol \xc3\x87ay services over 30-40 merchants, about 120 cups each of cay per day. They do it from a space that is easily one sixth the size of an average drive-thru coffee hut in the U.S. Sefa Ulusan often walks 70 kilometers per day. He likes that he\'s not stuck at a desk job, that he gets to meet people from all over the world and that he has even been an extra in three movies that were filmed in the Grand Bazaar. But he rarely has time to offer people tea, as he had me, and my interpreter Tuana Celik, the weather having something to do with the slower business that day.<br />\n<br />\n<a href="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-28-1430265147-3016427-IMG_2546.jpg"><img alt="2015-04-28-1430265147-3016427-IMG_2546.jpg" src="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-28-1430265147-3016427-IMG_2546-thumb.jpg" width="427" height="570" /></a><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nI took advantage of this moment of free time and asked Sefa about himself, what he\'s just finished reading (Les Miserables) and where he\'d like to go first if he could be a tourist like me (Africa). Pressing him further about this he said he wants to go to Madagascar because he was watching a documentary about "very slow animals that live in trees." The species name became lost in translation but we settled on sloth. He was quite taken by them and explained that he is an environmentalist at heart. "We\'ve tipped the balance of nature. If there were an organization in Istanbul to work against this I would devote time to it." <br />\n<br />\nWhen asked Sefa what, if anything, is a wish he might have for Istanbul he explained that in light of the previous day\'s suicide bombing at the nearby Sultanahmet police station, which killed an officer and injured others, he wished "that we could all just live in peace. That people have a right to good work and live democratically."<br />\n<br />\nOn this very cold day, I also had a chat with Talat Sanir a shoe shiner who has been working near the Spice Bazaar in Emin\xc3\xb6n\xc3\xbc for forty-five years. When I met him last spring I learned that he grew up in a village of Bingol in eastern Turkey that was struck by an earthquake in 1971. His family relocated to Gaziantep, where he bought one of his two antique shoe-shining stands. He then moved to Istanbul, where he has raised three children. Shoe shining is a trade he is proud of, he learned it from his father, who lived to be in his nineties. <br />\n<br />\nShining shoes in Gaziantep was much different than in Istanbul. That city is primarily industrial and most everyone wears similar, sturdy working man\'s shoes. In Istanbul, the footwear is fashionable and people come from all over the world to the Spice Bazaar. "I enjoy the challenge of variety."<br />\n<br />\nWhen asked for suggestions of Turkish authors to read or music to listen to he said that after day\'s work he goes to the Mimar Sinan Caf\xc3\xa9 in Suleymaniye for a bite to eat, nargile, and to listen to Turkish traditional music. Sometimes he will visit the nearby bathhouse and "lay on the hot stones to relax."<br />\n<br />\nTalat referred to himself as a ayakkabi boyacisi, a shoe dyer. When asked to share any secrets of the trade or what he learned from his father he turned to his stand and lifted one of many brass knobs, which serve as a cap to a square glass bottle. Showing me the paste inside, he said, "It is almond cream. I mix it with my dye pastes." He lifted several other brass caps revealing several other premixed dye colors. Pointing to a large, blue plastic jar featuring a mosque image on the label, he said, "Nurileflef. It\'s the best brand of shoe dye on the market."<br />\n<br />\nHis advice for a good life? "Get up early and go to work. This is how to live."<br />\n<br />\nAfter visiting with Talat Sanir last spring I pondered what he\'d said about the fantastic variety of footwear he now shines upon moving to Istanbul and I thought of two additional questions I wanted to ask him. My curiosity brought me back to his shoeshine stand this January. He wore a water repellent winter coat and a black cap with earflaps pulled snugly over his ears and he sat beside a brazier that gave off terrific heat. The coals, he said, are also good for drying people\'s shoes. Pulling up two chairs for myself, and my interpreter, he asked the \xc3\xa7ay seller to bring us the customary tea. <br />\n<br />\nMeanwhile my interpreter told him the Western version of Cinderella, which he hadn\'t before heard. I wished to know what, if any, was his most unusual shoe? Did he ever polish a glass slipper? He smiled, and told us it actually happened one day in Gaziantep when he\'d been working on men\'s work boots and along came a woman with "heels like he\'d never seen."<br />\n<br />\nLike hairdressers, shoe shiners must also hear personal stories from their customers. Has any one story stayed with him? <br />\n<br />\nWithout pause and with a straight face, Talat said, "Yes. One day an American woman came to sit with me and ask me about my work. I thought about her after she left and realized she had not given me her address or even the chance to shine her shoes."<br />\n<br />\nI laughed with him, despite my embarrassment. Had I not left him my card? Did he not see last spring that his fellow shoe shiner Mustafa had just shined my shoes while I had waited to speak with him that afternoon? <br />\n<br />\nTalat\'s words were a poignant reminder of how easily we become each other\'s stories. How readily we, though hemispheres apart, can either buoy or burden each others spirits with the narratives we sketch of one another. <br />\n<br />\nLater, I met a friend Cengiz Tekin, owner of Barefoot Travel, who helps people to see a side of his country they might not otherwise, and return home with rich stories of their own. His office is located around the corner from the Sutlanahmet police station. The bombing had saddened him, as it would anyone, and he couldn\'t help but be worried for his family as well as for Turkey in general. <br />\n<br />\nOn a positive note, none of his clients had cancelled their trips to Turkey after hearing the news. His business has grown steadily since 2008 and he serves some 14,000 customers. Many come from India and the Far East and to a lesser extent from Europe and the Americas. He wishes he\'d see more travelers in Istanbul from the West and that they understood that they are most welcome in Turkey. But he realizes that the regional wars and tragic events in Paris that same week don\'t help matters. <br />\n<br />\nWe met at Seflar Caf\xc3\xa9 for traditional Turkish food. Barefoot Travel offers food tours to restaurants that serve only at lunchtime called lokantalar, where the customer makes their selection of the day\'s offerings from a steaming buffet case. I opted for a traditional vegetable dish zeytinyagli parasa, braised lentils and carrots made with subtle spices, and a spinach souffl\xc3\xa9. <br />\n<br />\nCengiz\'s designs unusual tours of the city, to haunts other guides rarely go. He even hires local guides as "companions" to accompany people as they pursue their own agenda in Istanbul. Photographers, other artists and people traveling alone have requested accompaniment by someone who wouldn\'t necessarily provide historical information about the city\'s sites but rather provide the "know how" on getting around and Turkish translation as needed. Similarly, Barefoot Travel works with employees of businesses who open offices here. Also, Cengiz understands the hassles that members of the gay community sometime face when traveling abroad with their partners (being asked to leave hotels, restaurants, cabs). His agency helps LGBTQ tourists feel at home in Istanbul.<br />\n<br />\nCengiz\'s innovative bent doesn\'t end there. He understands that people of any age might need extra assistance navigating the city. They may have mobility, dietary concerns and other special needs. In the future he hopes to offer specialized tours to address these challenges while assisting travelers in discovering an Istanbul where a cup of cay, a shoeshine, and a new friend might await them. <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\'http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n      <enclosure url="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1464944/images/s-US_UK_CA-mini.jpg" type="image/jpeg" length="0"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/12/best-cities-for-grads_n_7242742.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[The 10 Best Cities For College Grads In 2015]]></title>\n      <author>Suzy Strutner</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/12/best-cities-for-grads_n_7242742.html</link>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2015 16:12:20 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[New grads know that choosing where to move after college depends on job potential first, followed by a slew of other factors.<br />\n<br />\nA new index from the the <a href="https://www.aier.org/edi" target="_hplink">American Institute for Economic Research (AIER)</a> ranks U.S. metros on their desirability for recent college grads, taking into account both job opportunities and "amenities" like restaurants, well-priced apartments and the ease of biking to work. <br />\n<br />\nThe report measured <a href="https://www.aier.org/edi" target="_hplink">75 metros</a> on factors including employment rates, racial diversity and the average salary for residents aged 22-35 with a bachelor\'s degree or higher. The lineup may be somewhat surprising, with college towns like <strong>Iowa City, Iowa; Ithaca, New York; and Ann Arbor, Michigan</strong> at the top. College campuses make these cities ethnically diverse, AIER\'s director of research and education Rosalind Greenstein told The Huffington Post. They also make cities hotspots for big-name corporations.<br />\n<br />\n"A growing technology corridor has improved economic opportunity in Iowa City, and low rents, more restaurants and bars, as well as a diverse population, also attract young people," Greenstein said about the list\'s top-rated location for college grads.<br />\n<br />\nStandard "big cities" like <strong>Washington, D.C., New York City and San Francisco</strong> also hit the top of the list, with high salaries, numerous start-up companies and full slates of restaurants and attractions that make them great options for recent grads. Whether sprawling metros or smaller towns, <a href="https://www.aier.org/edi" target="_hplink">the list</a> is full of cities ripe for exploration. Here are the <a href="https://www.aier.org/edi" target="_hplink">top employment destinations for college grads in 2015</a> according to the American Institute for Economic Research:<br />\n<br />\n<big><strong>10.

With their ubiquity also comes the possibility of a missed connection: getting a ride from a guy who for some reason ends up making you feel butterflies in your stomach.<br />\n<br />\nThese connections don\'t often last any longer than it takes to get from one side of town to the other, but what if they could lead to something special and long-lasting? One Lyft driver in San Francisco ended up giving a New Year\'s kiss to one of her passengers (a fellow Lyft driver) and nine months later they got engaged.<br />\n<br />\nSo next time you take a Lyft and find yourself wondering if the driver is single, fasten to your seatbelt and get ready to go on the dating fast track. It\'s possible that you were meant to give this guy the green light and go out on a date.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>1. There is not such thing as coincidence.</strong><br />\n<br />\nThere\'s a reason why car-hailing rides have become one of the most popular scenarios in Craigslist missed connections. Think about it: out of all the people using the apps, what are the chances that you got on there just in time to score the sexy driver?<br />\n<br />\n<strong>2. You have his number for a reason.</strong><br />\n<br />\nThese car-hailing apps let you get in touch directly with your scheduled driver to plan your exact pick up location, but it also could be so you can text them later and ask them if they have a girlfriend. Which seems more likely?<br />\n<br />\n<strong>3. He looks sexy when he drives.</strong><br />\n<br />\nIf this guy is not potentially the one, then what\'s the point of seeing him effortlessly maneuvering a steering wheel and with that focused look in his eyes?<br />\n<br />\n<strong>4. He knows his way around.</strong><br />\n<br />\nUnless he just started driving for one of these apps, your driver is good with directions. Or at the very least, he\'ll actually listen to you when it comes to navigating the city.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>5. He can afford to be spontaneous.</strong><br />\n<br />\nUber, Lyft, and SideCar drivers have a very flexible work schedule, perfect for when you decide to use your remaining "sick" for the two of you to go on a spontaneous getaway.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>6. He doesn\'t give up.</strong><br />\n<br />\nWhen the economy got tough and he couldn\'t find a job, this guy didn\'t just sit on his couch and wait for an opportunity to arise. No, he was proactive and resourceful. He embraced the new sharing economy and used his car to earn some extra cash.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>7. He\'s already been vetted.</strong><br />\n<br />\nLast year, after a few sketchy situations, Uber implemented tougher criminal background checks on all its drivers. The company claims that these background checks are more strict than what is required for California limo and taxi drivers.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>8. You can be yourself.</strong><br />\n<br />\nJust think of your next Lyft ride as glorified speed dating. You can share as much personal information as possible in a short amount of time. Studies have shown that honest communication is the basis for any relationship. And if it doesn\'t go well, then you don\'t have to see that guy ever again. Remember reason #1? What are the chances he\'ll pick you up again?<br />\n<br />\n<strong>9. He won\'t ever judge you.</strong><br />\n<br />\nYour Uber driver has seen it all giving drunken people rides on Friday and Saturday nights, so he won\'t judge you when you have one too many cocktails and need a sober ride. In fact, he\'ll be your knight in a shining Prius.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>10. There\'s no rule against it.</strong><br />\n<br />\nSo you\'ve made your decision: you want to date your Lyft driver. Who\'s going to stop you, boo? These services are so unregulated for a reason. <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\'http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n      <enclosure url="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2808916/images/s-UBER-mini.jpg" type="image/jpeg" length="0"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-sanderson/197000-views-of-bad-boy-n_b_7245748.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[197,000 Fans View \'Bad Boy\' Nick Kyrgios\'s #VolleyingChallenge - He Nominates Andy Murray & Serena Williams to "Go to the Wall Against Cancer"]]></title>\n      <author>Paul Sanderson</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-sanderson/197000-views-of-bad-boy-n_b_7245748.html</link>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2015 16:10:40 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-08-1431126026-1664419-KyrgiosMadrid2.jpg"><img alt="2015-05-08-1431126026-1664419-KyrgiosMadrid2.jpg" src="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-08-1431126026-1664419-KyrgiosMadrid2-thumb.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a><br />\n<br />\nNew 20-year-old Aussie tennis sensation Nick Kyrgios has come perilously close to being defaulted for language and/or racquet and ball abuse at the US Open, the Australian Open, where John McEnroe was famously defaulted in 1990, and the Estoril Open in Portugal.  He defeated Rafael Nadal last year at Wimbledon, and now one of his childhood idols, Roger Federer, at the Madrid Open on May 6th.  During a changeover, Roger was heard on camera saying, "We need a clown for this circus."<br />\n<br />\nA different side of Nick is that on losing his grandmother Julianah days after his win over Nadal, he had "74" tattooed on one finger, the age she passed away.  At the Australian Open in January, he fell to one knee after each of his wins and kissed that finger.  He participated in the Relay for Life cancer event in his hometown Canberra in March even while recovering from an ankle injury.  And now he\'s the first ATP World Tour player to take the #VolleyingChallenge.<br />\n<br />\nNaomi Watts, Jessica Chastain, and Anthony LaPaglia helped on Twitter with the lead-in to it.  The Australian Open and the French Open have supported the challenge, sharing Nick\'s volleying video, and Tennis on Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tennis/posts/765691040211322" target="_hplink">posted it</a> to its 11 million followers.  In the video, which now has 197,000 views, Nick uses the catchphrase for the challenge, "go to the wall against cancer," asks fans to "sign Briggs\'s petition," and nominates Andy Murray, Serena Williams, and fellow-upcoming Aussie Thanasi Kokkinakis, who also has an earring but not Nick\'s crazy haircut.<br />\n<br />\nThe aim of the challenge is to get a million signatures on the <a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/petition-for-briggs-for-cancer-immunotherapy-for-all" target="_hplink">Petition</a> for Briggs for Cancer Immunotherapy for All.  This is the #VolleyingChallenge <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VolleyingChallenge/posts/642160129223747" target="_hplink">post on Facebook</a>.  Briggs\'s tennis story is in the YouTube description of my volleying video there.<br />\n<br />\nI shot the video in New York, on the handball courts in Greenwich Village where we\'d hit together every Sunday morning.  After Facebook posted it, too, comments ranged from "Fast freakin hands" to "WOW!" to "good heavens! what great hands; control and focus!!! amazing!"<br />\n<br />\nBriggs would have been pleased.  I taught her to play and she\'d always wanted me to make one.  I ended up making it in her memory to send it to the 7 tennis greats on the petition when asking them to sign: Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Evonne Goolagong-Cawley, the Bryan Bros, Andy Roddick, and Ana Ivanovic.  19 stars have signed too, including Naomi Watts, Bradley Cooper, Emily Blunt, Scarlett Johansson, Rob Lowe, Debra Messing, Penelope Cruz, and Elle Macpherson.<br />\n<br />\nOf course, the #VolleyingChallenge is more about heart than skill, to get the signatures for this new era to begin.  Any player at any level can take it, or no level.  Meredith Vieira\'s also on Briggs\'s petition.

Your life which previously consisted of regimented schedules around school, sports, and extra-curricular activities is now completely changing. You\'re on your own and the future is in your hands. It might seem scary at first, and you might feel like a child who is not at all ready for this, but you are and you\'ll realize it soon.<br />\n<br />\nTo jump start the process, I\'d like to share some words of wisdom with you. If only I had known all of the below when I graduated college, maybe I could have jump started the process too.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>1. You\'re probably not going to see half of the people you were friends with in college ever again. </strong>Okay, maybe you\'ll see people once or twice after graduating, but you\'re about to start a new life. Not everyone can come. Be sure to make an effort to keep in touch with the people you want in your life though or else they will become a faint memory of the past, as sad as that sounds.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>2. Don\'t start working right away if you don\'t have to.</strong> Once the real world hits, it\'s going to hit hard... with a lot of strict policies about vacation time and stuff. You shouldn\'t be in a race to get to the real world. After all, it\'s not a finish line -- it\'s the very beginning actually, and everyone has different starting times.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>3. You\'re still going to meet new people after college whether it be a new friend, a new enemy, or a new sig-oth.</strong> Although I once believed I would never meet anyone after graduating college, I was wrong. You can meet people at work, through mutual friends, at parties, and at the gym. Just because college is over doesn\'t mean your only hope for finding true love is now in the hands of Hinge and OK Cupid, even though browsing such online dating networks certainly won\'t hurt.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>4. If you stay in on a random Saturday night, you\'re probably not going to miss out on anything.</strong> You\'ll realize it soon enough... Same sh*t, different weekend night. If you can\'t make it out one night, or you just don\'t feel like going out, it won\'t be the end of the world. Go out when you want to go out and stay in when you want to stay in. It\'s simple.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>5. Just because you\'re making money doesn\'t mean you have to spend it.</strong> You might be able to pay for an apartment while still having extra money to put towards groceries, the gym, and wine, but that doesn\'t mean you should be paying for that apartment. Instead, save as much money as you can to go towards a new car or a starter home in a few years. It\'s probably the most important thing you can do for yourself right now.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>6. Settling does not mean the same thing when it comes to relationships as it does when it comes to your career.</strong> Getting experience (ANY experience) is going to help you climb the ladder faster than sitting around waiting for your dream job to come to you. You need experience to get your dream job. And you need experience to find out what that ideal dream job is. All experience is good experience.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>7. Rejection is a good thing.</strong> It would be weird if everyone wanted you to work for them, and it would be weird if you wanted to work for every company you interviewed at. Job searching is like dating -- the connection has to be mutual, or it\'s just not going to work out. Finding a mutual connection takes time, but once you find it, everything will all work out for the best.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>8. Follow your passion.</strong> Don\'t think you are limited to doing whatever your college degree says you should be doing. The sky is the limit. If you find you want to go in a different direction, go in a different direction. If you find you want to continue doing what you\'re doing, do it. Put yourself out there. Do something in addition to your full-time job. You can\'t just go through the motions and expect greatness to happen. You have to work for it.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>9. If you want to move, JUST DO IT.</strong> Now is the time. Sure you can still move later on in your 20s and later on in your life, but you\'re starting the next chapter of your life. Why move home or stay put for the beginning of this next chapter when you know eventually you\'d like to try living elsewhere? No need to delay what you know you want to begin.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>10. You\'re not special.</strong> You might be unique and you might have skills that set you apart from the crowd, but in the real world there are plenty of people out there just like you and no one (I mean NO ONE) is going to award you or praise you for your successes. You\'re only going to get berated for your failures, and guess what? You are going to have many failures because without failures, success wouldn\'t exist. So learn from your mistakes and then do the honor of patting yourself on the back because no one else is going to do it for you. This isn\'t elementary school where you get trophies for just being on the team. This is adulthood. Welcome.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>11. It\'s okay to have no idea what you want to do in life.</strong> You\'re not supposed to know that right now. Even if you think you know exactly what you want in life, you don\'t and that\'s fine. If by the end of your twenties you\'ve got it all figured out, good for you. 99 percent of 29-year-olds probably don\'t have it figured out. Actually, I feel like humans may never feel like they have it ALL figured out, but if you go with the flow and take life as it comes things will work out as they should. Life never slows down and it\'s always full of surprises. Take them as they come.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>12. Yeah, you probably just experienced four of the best years of your life, but the rest of your 20s -- and the rest of your life -- will hold some amazing years too.</strong>  Never again will you experience the situations you did in college, but as you get older those situations won\'t be ones you desire to experience anymore. If you told my recent-grad-self that one day I\'d choose sitting on the couch in sweatpants drinking wine on a Saturday night over taking shots of vodka at the club, I would have laughed in your face. But now, I do sometimes choose wine and couch on Saturday nights. Keyword: sometimes.<br />\n<br />\nMy advice to all you newly-grads is to take life as it comes. Do what you want to do and embrace the changes that are about to come. Go at your own pace. Don\'t rush adulthood, but don\'t delay it. Things are not necessarily going to get "worse" and they\'re not going to get "better." They\'re just going to be different, and seeing as "change" is the only constant in life, that\'s a good thing. Without change, life would be pretty boring. You are about to *spice up your life* more than the Spice Girls ever did. Cheers to post-grad life. Now go take a shot or five while you still have the tolerance in you!<br />\n<br />\n<strong><a href="http://forevertwentysomethings.com/2015/05/12/things-wish-knew-when-graduated-college/" target="_hplink">This post originally appeared on Forever Twenty Somethings.</a></strong> <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\'http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n      <enclosure url="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2942924/images/s-COLLEGE-mini.jpg" type="image/jpeg" length="0"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joseph-m-costa-/why-freddie-gray-matters-_b_7261144.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[Why Freddie Gray Matters to All of Us]]></title>\n      <author>Joseph M.

Every time an incident like that of the death of Freddie Gray occurs, I am reminded that the African-American residents we serve are as much at risk because of the color of their skin as for any of their behaviors. <br />\n<br />\nIn particular, I am reminded of one of our current residents who, a month ago, was going through a very challenging time.  He was very oppositional and defiant, requiring tremendous staff attention.  He attempted to leave the campus without authorization and in general presented in a very threatening way. At any given time during this period he was much more at risk to himself than anyone else, but I worry that such behavior displayed in the community could lead to law enforcement intervention. As much as the vast majority of police officers are well-trained and professional, all it takes is just one poor judgment call, and life can change in an instant.<br />\n<br />\nRecently I spoke with this same resident who was sporting a tie and beaming with pride after returning from a job interview. From being overwhelmed and defiant he has become confident and determined, and it was a delight to see. But the story of Freddie Gray and that of so many African-American men, who have been the objects of police violence, continues to cause me to worry for the safety and well-being of many of the young African Americans we serve.<br />\n<br />\nIt is not acceptable that parents of these young adults must warn their sons to be cautious when dealing with the police as it is not acceptable that those who have sworn to keep the peace are held in suspicion. <br />\n<br />\nThe unfortunate story of Freddie Gray points to deep-seated issues that plague our society and must be addressed. We cannot be satisfied with a defensive strategy that reinforces suspicion and divides our communities. Rather, we must encourage a soul-searching examination of the root causes of such injustices. Institutional racism is very much a source of the injustice. Stereotyping, character profiling, and unchallenged biases all contribute to an environment that justifies force without due cause and allows for intentional indifference and disregard for a person\'s well-being. <br />\n<br />\nIt is this kind of situation that has galvanized not only Baltimore but the whole nation to raise up a cry for justice not just for Freddie Gray but anyone who becomes the victim of unnecessary force just because of the color of their skin. Some may argue that the alleged perpetrator was to blame. Regardless of reasonable cause, there is no justification for unnecessary force or negligence. <br />\n<br />\nThese incidents are all too common and our attention to such horrors is quickly diverted.  However, we must not be distracted from our resolve to address the injustice that threatens the well-being and safety of the children and youth we serve simply because of the color of their skin.<br />\n<br />\n<em>This blog post originally ran in Hillsides<a href="https://hillsidescommunity.wordpress.com/" target="_hplink"> blog. </a></em> <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\'http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n      <enclosure url="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1464944/images/s-US_UK_CA-mini.jpg" type="image/jpeg" length="0"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/buster-ross/homosexuality-is-not-an-a_b_7245516.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[\'Homosexuality Is Not an Addiction\']]></title>\n      <author>Buster Ross</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/buster-ross/homosexuality-is-not-an-a_b_7245516.html</link>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2015 16:07:40 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/women-who-stray/201505/homosexuality-is-not-addiction" target="_hplink">Homosexuality is Not an Addiction</a> is the title of a piece that just came out on Psychology Today. Dr. David Ley\'s piece <em>cannot</em> be ignored in the conversation on LGBTQ rights and "conversion therapy."<br />\n<br />\nI have been reviewing a position statement opposing "conversion therapy" that will soon be released by an organization that inspired me to do my part in protecting LGBTQ youth in Oregon.  It will join countless position statements across all of the nation\'s leading professional medical and mental health associations opposing such practices. Position statements like this one are a big part of why yesterday, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/buster-ross/the-oregon-senate-just-pa_1_b_7235176.html" target="_hplink">the Oregon Senate joined the Oregon House in passing a bill banning "conversion therapy" with bipartisan support.</a> <br />\n<br />\nI was there for the vote. And as I walked out of the State Capitol, I was greeted by a cool breeze on a sunny Oregon day. I heard the voices of singing children now gathered on those same steps, and looked out on a bright future for the youth of Oregon. <br />\n<br />\n<a href="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-08-1431123653-4548808-20150507_1228041.jpg"><img alt="2015-05-08-1431123653-4548808-20150507_1228041.jpg" src="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-08-1431123653-4548808-20150507_1228041-thumb.jpg" width="570" height="320" /></a><br />\n<br />\nBut it was only a few hours later that I saw a headline on my newsfeed that made me once again feel a nagging desperation that has haunted me relentlessly over the past year. <a href="http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2015/05/bullied-wisconsin-transgender-teen-dies-by-suicide/" target="_hplink">Another bullied transgender teen had committed suicide</a>.<br />\n<br />\nI chose to become a Certified Sexuality Counselor because of a belief in the importance of highly-specialized training, professional standards, and accountability, when it comes to supporting people in their most vulnerable selves, in their sexuality.

Social-media crazed. Entitled. Unfocused. By now you\'ve likely read a dozen editorials about Millennials and their effect on the American workplace. And by now you probably have several coworkers in their twenties and have been able to separate fact from fiction. (You also probably got them to help you figure out Twitter). <br />\n<br />\nAccording to <a href="http://onlinemba.unc.edu/mba-at-unc-blog/geny-in-the-workplace/" target="_hplink">this study</a> from the University of North Carolina, Millennials will make up 46 percent of the workforce by 2020. The influx of Millennials in the workforce has already posed a bit of a challenge for many companies, as it can be difficult to integrate this younger generation into the workplace. Considering Millennials\' needs and desires while balancing Baby Boomer expectations and practices is no easy feat. But, your company is making it work. Your company\'s corporate culture has adapted to accommodate the new multi-generational workforce. You\'ve managed to satisfy both the twenty-somethings and those in their forties and fifties.  You can sit back and take a break from corporate restructuring for a while, right? Not quite.<br />\n<br />\nYou might have just gotten a handle on the Millennials, but it\'s already time to prepare for the next generation trickling into the workforce: Generation Z. Born in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Generation Z is growing up at the peak of technological advancement and innovation. This generation doesn\'t know a world without sleek laptops, smartphones, and the ability to connect with people via online communities.<br />\n<br />\nGrowing up under such circumstances, GenZ-ers are tech-savvy, vocal, and adaptable. But all that time online means they struggle to develop strong interpersonal skills, use appropriate body language, and understand privacy. As a whole, they\'re noticeably different from previous generations and they\'re bound to drive changes in corporate culture on an even greater scale than the Millennials did. Get ready, it\'s time to restructure... again.<br />\n<br />\nWe still have five to 10 years before Generation Z is fully integrated into the workforce, but as the challenge of accommodating the Millennials demonstrated, it\'s better to prepare sooner than later. Here are five ways to better meet Generation Z\'s needs while taking advantage of the unique skills they will bring to the table:<br />\n<br />\n<strong>1. Replace your old organization chart with a project-based one.  </strong><br />\n<br />\nTake notes from some of the new-age tech companies, like Medium and Zappos. These companies are ditching traditional hierarchy for <a href="http://firstround.com/review/How-Medium-is-building-a-new-kind-of-company-with-no-managers/" target="_hplink">Holacracy</a>, a corporate structure without managers. While you don\'t need to completely throw out job titles, consider shifting the focus in your company\'s organization chart from individual titles to team-based projects. Even as fresh hires, the hyper-connected Gen Z-ers will have strong networks available to them. When you allow them to put these networks to use they\'ll feel more engaged and more valuable to your company. And as all leaders know, engagement is the key to quality work.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>2. Broaden your notion of diversity. Gen Z is the most diverse generation in history thus far, and they like it that way. </strong><br />\n<br />\nBorn and raised in a highly interconnected world, Gen Z is accustomed to diversity. They may not see a need to actively encourage diversity or inclusion in the workplace because they assume it\'s already present. The companies that will attract and retain Gen Z employees and the diverse perspectives they have to offer will be those organizations whose culture is fundamentally shaped by diversity. By making diversity a core part of your corporate culture you\'ll be able to spark more creative conversations in the office, increase the engagement of Gen Z-ers, and drive more business solutions.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>3. Create sparring zones.</strong><br />\n<br />\nSparring zones are spaces of power-free collaboration where employees of all levels can come together to share ideas, concerns, and plans. They\'re a space where employees work together in a respectful and responsive way. Having grown up with social media apps at their fingertips, Gen Z-ers are accustomed to freely expressing their thoughts, knowledge, and opinions online. This taste for self-expression will show up anywhere they work, and sparring zones will provide them with an environment in which they can be heard. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>4. Teach the personal and the technical.</strong><br />\n<br />\nWhile Gen-Z employees will probably be more tech-savvy than you are, their interpersonal skills might be less refined. It\'s important to adjust company training programs accordingly. Beyond addressing technical issues, programs should train Gen Z about relationship building, body language, cultural dynamics, and privacy. Even in our increasingly tech-oriented world, the ability to interact and connect with others in person remains important. Your company should ensure that the future Gen-Z employees are trained to be as effective at communicating face-to-face as they are online.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>5. Train in real time and make it engaging.</strong><br />\n<br />\nWhen teaching technical skills to Gen Z-ers, consider training them in real time. Generation Z has a short attention span centered on the "here and now." If they\'re not actually using the skills they\'re being taught at that very moment, they will be less likely to see the skills as relevant, and therefore less likely to retain them. Your company should replace some preplanned learning activities (like lectures) with more engaging activities that will teach Gen Z employees skills they can use and apply immediately.<br />\n<br />\nThe next generation of workers is sure to present some challenges -- just like any new generation -- and they will require some changes within the corporate structure. The task of adjusting (again) to the unique needs and wants of an entire generation may seem daunting, but making these changes will benefit the new generation and your company alike. Make sure you are equipped to handle the arrival of Gen Z and prepare early. And remember that, while they are seemingly unfocused and entitled, they will bring with them fresh ideas and energy that only they can provide.<br />\n<br />\n<em><a href="http://ericadhawan.com" target="_hplink">Erica Dhawan</a> is an author, keynote speaker and the CEO of<a href="http://cotential.co" target="_hplink"> Cotential</a>, a global training and consulting firm.

Here she explores the new reality of living in a world where "terms and conditions <strong>will</strong> apply."<br />\n</em><br />\nAs a kid growing up in the \'90s, I watched the Disney Channel original movie, <em>Smart House</em>, where a teenage boy wins a computerized dream house, fully equipped with a speaking electronic housewife. The digital housewife becomes obsessed with the family that moves in, watching their every move and wanting to become a part of the real human family. As a child, I can remember thinking how odd it was to imagine having technology know what you\'re thinking and doing at all times.<br />\n<br />\nFast-forward 16 years: talking to Siri is just a typical part of a busy day, websites know what we need and want, and companies target ads that reflect our most recent Google searches. Recently, Amazon produced a physical device called the <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/03/31/amazon-smart-home/" target="_hplink">Dash button</a>, which became available to the United States last month on an invite-only basis. The button, slightly larger than your thumb and accessible via Wi-Fi, automatically orders another shipment of any product of your choice from your Amazon Prime account--all with a click of a button. Companies are rushing to partner up with the Dash button phenomenon in the hopes of increasing sales and brand recognition. For example, Whirlpool has partnered with Amazon to create Whirpool\'s Cabrio line of washers and dryers that, with a simple software update, <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/03/31/amazon-smart-home/" target="_hplink">notifies Amazon when you need more laundry detergent</a>. Have no fear; the "Smart House" has become a reality.<br />\n <br />\nReading this article reminded me of watching the 2013 documentary, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084953/" target="_hplink"><em>"Terms and Conditions May Apply"</em></a> in my Communication and Law class. The film brought to light how we now live in a world where hitting "accept" means so little to us, but so much more to the companies\' collecting our data. How will Amazon users feel about the Dash button? Will they readily accept the terms and conditions policy for this new device?<br />\n <br />\nAfter watching <em>Terms and Conditions</em>, which some might categorize as a horror film, I began to think about all the "I accept" boxes I have clicked in recent months: iTunes, Google, Amazon, Twitter, and Facebook. When accepting these companies\' terms and conditions, we as consumers are giving away our personal information to the corporation and at times, often without even reading what we are giving to them. As pointed out in the documentary, it\'s now even easier for the government to get our information from these sites, and unfortunately, we have handed it to them on a silver platter.<br />\n <br />\nCullen Hoback, the director of the documentary, points out how LinkedIn had, until recently, one of the most appalling terms and conditions ever written, calling it "abysmal, "overreaching," and "ridiculous." He also argues that Apple goes too far in order to protect themselves. For example, Apple\'s <a href="http://thenextweb.com/media/2013/07/22/qa-terms-and-conditions-may-apply-director-cullen-hoback-on-the-attempted-death-of-privacy/" target="_hplink">iTunes conditions state</a> that, "You also agree that you will not use these products for any purposes prohibited by United States Law, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture, or production of nuclear, missile, or chemical or biological weapons". LinkedIn, which is used by more than 300 million people across the world, cited in its terms and conditions prior to October, 2014 that, "You grant LinkedIn a nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, perpetual, unlimited, assignable... right to us to copy, prepare derivative works of, distribute...use and commercialize, in any way... any information you provide... to LinkedIn, including... any user generated content, ideas, concepts, techniques or data to the services, you submit to LinkedIn, without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you." While the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/pop/preview/pop-user-agreement-summary" target="_hplink">terms have changed</a> to reduce concerns, this basically meant that if you were a LinkedIn user before 2014 and you published a great idea on your profile, LinkedIn had permission to commercialize your content.

And then in happens. Their spouse was unfaithful. <br />\n<br />\nThat\'s when reality sets in. It\'s easy to think you will leave if your spouse betrays you, but when confronted with the reality of divorce and dissolving your marriage, the stakes are really high. It\'s not that overcoming the devastation of infidelity is easy, it isn\'t. But it can be done. <br />\n<br />\nIn fact, believe it or not, most people decide to stay in their marriages after infidelity. The important thing is to address the issues that might have lead to the infidelity and get the necessary help to recover. <br />\n<br />\nDivorce isn\'t the solution, particularly when the unfaithful spouse is remorseful and devoted to changing. Here are some things you need to know if you are dealing with the fallout of infidelity in your marriage<br />\n<br />\n<strong>1) Betrayal is in the eye of the beholder</strong><br />\n<br />\nMany times people want to know the definition of betrayal. To some, it is about having intercourse and other sexual contact with another person. To others, betrayal is more about one\'s spouse feeling emotionally connected to someone else- late conversations of a personal nature with a co-worker, or an on-going, intimate friendship with another person. <br />\n<br />\nTo others, it is secrecy. This may involve secret email accounts, cell phones, Internet behavior, or an unwillingness to share information about whereabouts, spending habits, or life plans.<br />\n<br />\nThe fact is, there is no universal definition of betrayal. When two people are married, they must care about each others\' feelings. They don\'t always have to agree, but they must behave in ways that make the relationship feel safe. <br />\n<br />\nTherefore, if one person feels threatened or betrayed, his or her spouse must do some soul searching and change in ways to accommodate those feelings. In other words, betrayal is in the eye of the beholder. If you or your partner feel betrayed, you need to change what you\'re doing to make the marriage work.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>2) Infidelity is not a marital deal breaker</strong><br />\n<br />\nMany people think that affairs signal the end of a marriage. This is simply not true. Although healing from infidelity is a challenging endeavor, most marriages not only survive, but they can actually grow from the experience. <br />\n<br />\nThis is not to say that affairs are good for marriages, they aren\'t. Affairs are very, very destructive because the bond of trust has been broken. But after years of working with couples who have experienced betrayal and affairs, I can vouch for the fact that it is possible to get marriages back on track and rediscover trust, caring, friendship and passion.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>3) Most affairs end</strong><br />\n<br />\nIt\'s important to know that, while affairs can be incredibly sexy, compelling, addictive and renewing, most of them end. That\'s because after the thrill wears off, most people recognize that everyone, even the affair partner is a package deal. <br />\n<br />\nThis means that we all have good points and bad points. When two people are in the throes of infatuation, they are only focusing on what\'s good. This is short-lived, generally speaking. That\'s because reality sets in and infatuation fades. If the betrayed spouse doesn\'t run to a divorce attorney prematurely, it\'s entirely possible and even like that an affair will die a natural death.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>4) Temporary insanity- the only sane response</strong><br />\n<br />\nBecause betrayal is so threatening to marriage and so devastating, many people feel they are losing their minds when they learn that their spouses have been cheating. They can\'t eat, sleep, work, think, or function in any substantial way. This causes another layer of concern and self-doubt which often leads to depression and anxiety.<br />\n<br />\nIt is important to know that finding out that one\'s spouse is cheating can be extremely traumatic. In fact, current research suggests that betrayed spouses exhibit symptoms similar to Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. It is a major loss and as with most losses, betrayal is intensely disorienting and distressing.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>5) You are not alone</strong><br />\n<br />\nAlthough when infidelity occurs, the betrayed spouse feels alone and lonely, it is essential to keep in mind that countless people have experienced the same problem and have felt the same way. This offers little consolation when one first learns about his or her spouse\'s affair, but over time, it can take the sting out of feeling so out of sorts. <br />\n<br />\nIt would be wonderful if everyone upheld their marital vows, but the truth is, that doesn\'t happen. It should, but it doesn\'t. The good news is that there is a great deal of support available because many people have walked in your shoes and can be empathetic to your feelings.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>6) It helps to get help</strong><br />\n<br />\nBut beyond talking with those who have experienced infidelity in their own marriages, it helps to get professional help. Feelings that surface after the discovery of an affair are often so overwhelming that it is difficult to know what to do to begin to get one\'s marriage back on track. <br />\n<br />\nA good marriage therapist or a marriage education class can help lead the way. But be certain to seek help that is "marriage-friendly." Some therapists believe that infidelity destroys the fabric of a relationship which cannot be repaired. These therapists declare marriages dead on arrival. It is essential that you get a good referral if you want your marriage to recover.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>7) Healing takes time</strong><br />\n<br />\nAlthough people naturally want to be pain-free as quickly as possible, when it comes to healing from infidelity, it just isn\'t going to happen. In fact, if things are "business as usual" too quickly, it probably just means that intense feelings have been swept under the carpet. <br />\n<br />\nThis will not help in the long run. In order for a marriage to mend, it takes a great deal of hard work to confront all the necessary issues. This takes time- often years- to truly get things back on track.<br />\n<br />\nWhen couples enter my office and they\'ve been dealing with the aftermath of infidelity for a year or so and they are still struggling, they think something is wrong with them. When I hear that, I tell them that nothing is wrong with them because the pain is still fresh and the news of infidelity is hot off the press. Yes, even a year after learning about betrayal isn\'t a very long time. <br />\n<br />\nHealing from infidelity is a slow process for most people.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>8 ) Count on ups and downs</strong><br />\n<br />\nOne of the most frustrating and confusing aspects to the healing process is the fact that just when people think things have improved and are resolved, there is another major setback. This is not surprising at all. <br />\n<br />\nThat\'s because the path to recovery is not s straight line. It is jagged and beset with many, many ups and downs. I tell people that it is two steps forward and one step back. Unfortunately, when people have a setback, they believe that they have slid back to square one. This is not the case. Every setback is a bit different. <br />\n<br />\nAnd as long as there is a general upward trend, progress is being made. Maintaining patience is difficult, but it is absolutely necessary. Don\'t give up when there has been a relapse. Just get back on track.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>9) Don\'t be quick to tell friends and family</strong><br />\n<br />\nIt is important not to be too quick to tell friends and family about the problem of infidelity. If everyone in one\'s family is apprised of the infidelity, even if the marriage improves, family members may not support the idea of staying in the marriage. They may pressure the betrayed spouse to leave. <br />\n<br />\nSo, while emotional support during this rough time is absolutely necessary, it\'s important to get professional help or talk to friends or family who will support the marriage and be less judgmental. Those people should have the perspective that no one is perfect, everyone makes mistakes and as long as the unfaithful spouse takes responsibility to change, marriages can mend.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>10) You won\'t forget, but forgiveness is a gift you give yours</strong>elf<br />\n<br />\nWhen there has been infidelity, people just don\'t forget about it. In fact, they don\'t ever forget it. What does happen is that memories of the discovery and the pain tend to fade. The thoughts about betrayal become less frequent and less intense over time. And the good news is that people should NOT forget because we all learn from our experiences, both good and bad.<br />\n<br />\nAnd although people don\'t forget betrayal or affairs, forgiveness is still mandatory, not to let the unfaithful person off the hook, but because holding a grudge shackles people to the past. It is bad for one\'s health, both emotionally and physically. There is no intimacy when there are grudges. Life is painful because there is a wall separating people. When betrayed spouses allow themselves to have feelings of forgiveness, life lightens up. It is freeing. Love begins to flow again. Letting go of the past begins to make room for happiness in the present. So, forgiveness isn\'t meant for the unfaithful, it is a gift betrayed spouses give themselves. <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\'http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n      <enclosure url="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1464944/images/s-US_UK_CA-mini.jpg" type="image/jpeg" length="0"/>\n    </item>\n  </channel>\n</rss>\n'
